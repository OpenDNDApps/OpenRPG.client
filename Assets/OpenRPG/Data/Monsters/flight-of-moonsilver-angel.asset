    a shard of the Helvault. Hit points lost to this weapon''s damage can be regained
    only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any
    other means. Once per turn, when the angel hits a creature with an attack using
    this weapon, it can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature''s
    turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time the angel has wounded it, and
    it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all
    such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a
    creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine)
    check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success."]}}}},"damageTags":["B","N","R"],"hasToken":true}'
