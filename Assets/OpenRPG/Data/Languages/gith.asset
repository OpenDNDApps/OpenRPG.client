    a single word, and multiple tir''su connect to form phrases and sentences.","Githyanki

    Similarly, the two races of gith differentiate their language by how they write
    it. Githyanki write a tir''su clockwise, starting at the top. Githzerai use the
    same letter symbols but write their tir''su counterclockwise, starting from the
    bottom."]}]}'
