  Title: Loross
  AsJson: '{"name":"Loross","source":"IDRotF","page":221,"script":"Draconic","entries":["Loross,
    a language spoken by the Netherese, is a dead tongue. Very few creatures in the
    world today would recognize it, much less speak it. Loross used the Draconic
    alphabet in its written form, while the spoken language had many similarities
    with Elvish, due to the cultural influence the elves had on Netherese civilization.
    A character who speaks Elvish can understand what a creature speaking Loross
    is saying, and vice versa. A character who has the Cloistered Scholar or Sage
    background, or a warlock who knows the Eyes of the Rune Keeper invocation, can
    translate written Loross without an ability check."]}'
