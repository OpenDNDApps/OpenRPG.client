  Title: Qualith
  AsJson: '{"name":"Qualith","source":"VGM","page":75,"typicalSpeakers":["{@creature
    Mind Flayer||Mind Flayers}"],"script":"Qualith","entries":["The \"writing\" of
    mind flayers, known as Qualith, isn''t as simple as a set of symbols representing
    sounds or ideas. An inscription in Qualith captures the thoughts of its creator
    and psionically transmits the thoughts to a mind flayer who later reads the inscription
    by touching it with its tentacles. Mind flayers write in Qualith by psionically
    imprinting their messages on nonmagical, nonliving material they grasp or caress
    with their tentacles. The imprinting causes imperceptible surface changes to
    the object, and abrasion or degradation of the material can cause the inscription
    to fade and fail.","An expression in Qualith is made up of four-line stanzas
    packed into interlocking blocks, creating complex patterns that are indecipherable
    by other creatures. Someone that touches a Qualith inscription, however, can
    receive fragmentary insight into the multilayered thoughts contained within it.
    A non-illithid that wants to understand a Qualith inscription can make an Intelligence
    check (DC based on the complexity of the contained thoughts) to try to derive
    some of the inscription''s meaning. Multiple successful attempts might uncover
    different aspects about the illithid author, its intended meaning, and its intended
    audience. A failed attempt results in a crushing headache and, in extreme cases,
    madness. A {@spell comprehend languages} spell provides understanding of the
    inscription roughly equivalent to what a mind flayer would get from it."]}'
