    Coast was settled by colonists from the arid land of Marquet, and their language
    now holds an unusual position in the Clovis Concord. It is the language of high
    society, as many Clovis elite are descended from Marquesians, but it is also
    the language of piracy, since countless lower-class Marquesians defected from
    the Concord and formed the Revelry pirates."]}'
