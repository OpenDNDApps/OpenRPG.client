    a halfling or gnome, you pass as a little person or a child. If you''re a half-elf,
    half-orc, or genasi, you disguise your non-human features. Other races use a
    combination of disguise and concealing clothing to hide. Your reasons for doing
    so are your own. Perhaps you''re a dissident or the agent of a foreign power.
