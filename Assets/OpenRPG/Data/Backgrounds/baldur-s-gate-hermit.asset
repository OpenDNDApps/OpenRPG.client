    slums and alley camps, you can get a damp bed and a bad meal, but also a degree
    of privacy and no questions asked. Living here isn't comfortable, but it's unlikely

    require you to stay in hiding until you actually are.\"],[\"3\",\"You study the
    puzzles of mortal natures. You've seen followers of evil deities perform miracles
    for the helpless at Twin Songs, and you've seen patriars who worship good deities
    turn their backs on the poor daily. Bearing witness to such things, and meditating
    on their contradictions, fills your hours.\"],[\"4\",\"You tend to some part
    of the city's forgotten history: the unmarked graves in Cliffside Cemetery, the
    crumbling remains of dead patriar families' manors, or a collection of religious
    texts stuffed into an attic and forgotten when a believer's patron deity died.

    to learn that the quest that drove you had become impossible to fulfill\u2014its

    directionless and unable to return to your homeland, you have lingered, adrift,
    in this wretched city.\"]]}]}]}}},\"hasFluff\":true}"
