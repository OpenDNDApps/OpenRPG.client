    were born into a nomadic tribe that called the Ticklebelly Hills home. You migrated

    the Dragonspine Mountains, and even occasionally east across the Stojanow River
    to the borders of the Quivering forest.\",\"In your migrations, your people have
    come to know the stone giant tribes that populate the Giant's Cairn. The dragon
    cultists came to the hills one day\u2014magic-users wearing purple and riding
    horrid beasts, black-clad warriors wearing wicked masks, and even soldiers from
    the nearby town of Phlan. Then the dragon called Vorgansharax arrived and laired
    in the hills, causing horrid thickets to grow and animals to act unusually. The
    cultists began raiding nomad camps for victims to offer to the wyrm. Eventually,
    the dragon moved on to attack Phlan, but life was never again the same for the
    nomads of the Ticklebelly Hills.\"]},{\"name\":\"Feature: At Home in the Wild\",\"type\":\"entries\",\"entries\":[\"The

    magical, or are actively seeking you out might do so with difficulty depending
    on the nature of the threat (as determined by the DM). However, this feature

    or put you in a state of wonder. Was it this wonder that enticed you into a life
    of adventuring? On the other hand, you are fiercely protective of and dedicated
    to your tribe. Perhaps it was this dedication that led you to venture out; either
