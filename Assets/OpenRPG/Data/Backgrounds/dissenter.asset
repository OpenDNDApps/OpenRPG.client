    in the carefully constructed and curated city-state of Naktamun, and in the presence
    of the five gods, some people rebel against the doctrines of the God-Pharaoh.
    They don't challenge the existence of the gods, of course, for those gods are
    visible nearly every day in the streets of the city. Nor do they question the
    fact of life after death, which is plain to see in the anointed mummies that
    surround them, as well as the marauding mummies outside the Hekma. Rather, these
    dissenters simply refuse to follow the ordained course of life that leads to
    the glorious afterlife.\",\"Some dissenters are spurred by fear, not wanting
    to subject themselves to a violent death in the trials (or in training for the
    trials). Some are moved by conscience, unwilling to kill their crop-mates in
    the trials. For while they cannot deny that the gods exist, they can deny that
    the gods are just\u2014and can fight to prove that the dictates of an unjust
    god need not be obeyed. Some believe that one god (probably Bontu) has corrupted
    the process of the trials and the path to the afterlife. Others correctly intuit
    that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people's best interests in mind
    when he ordered their society.\",\"A character who is identified as a dissenter
