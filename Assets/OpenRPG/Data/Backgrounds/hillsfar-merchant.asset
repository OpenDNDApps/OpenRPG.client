    the City of Trade. Your family operated warehouses, organized caravans, managed
    stores, or owned a ship and has trade contacts throughout the Moonsea region,
    as well as up and down the length of the Sword Coast. Perhaps they import ore,
    uncut gems, untreated furs, or grain into the City of Trade, or they export fine
    cloth, faceted gems, fine furs, or Dragon''s Breath, a brandy-like liquor. Regardless,
    you''ve largely given that life up for some reason and have chosen to seek adventure
    instead. Nevertheless, the training you received then, and perhaps the contacts
