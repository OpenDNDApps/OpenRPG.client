    kingpin still plots a personal revenge.\"],[\"2\",\"The Guild took over your
    family business, ran it into the ground, and burned the building for insurance
    money. You were driven into crime yourself, but you'll never work for the Guild.
    You take special joy in hitting its targets first, tipping off its con victims
    and otherwise frustrating its schemes.\"],[\"3\",\"It's always been about money.
    You're not paid what you're worth, working for someone who has more than they
    deserve. But the Guild offered you a way to fix that. You keep doing what you've
    always done\u2014guard work, dock labor, business accounting\u2014but what you
    learn you pass on to the Guild.\"],[\"4\",\"The inequality of Baldur's Gate has
    driven you to take matters into your own hands. You steal from patriars and rich
    Lower City residents, funneling the money through charitable fronts to help the
    needy.\"],[\"5\",\"You got into crime as a bored patriar looking for excitement.
    Your family has no idea of your activities, and neither does the Guild. If either
    of them ever finds out, your life as you know it will be over.\"],[\"6\",\"A
    close friend or relative joined the Guild and vanished mysteriously. You've worked
    your way into the lower ranks hoping to find out what happened to them.\"],[\"7\",\"You've
    always wanted to be a member of the Guild. As a child, you looked up to the Guild
    members' swagger, their flashy dress, and their competence, which all marked
    them as different from the other adults you knew. As soon as you could, you joined
    the organization.\"],[\"8\",\"To you, this is just a way to earn a living. You
    go to work, do what needs to be done, and get paid. Anyone who pursues crime
    for thrill-seeking, to strike back at unjust authorities, or anything else are
    amateurs, and they're liable to get you arrested or killed with their idiocy.\"]]}]}]}}},\"hasFluff\":true,\"hasFluffImages\":true}"
