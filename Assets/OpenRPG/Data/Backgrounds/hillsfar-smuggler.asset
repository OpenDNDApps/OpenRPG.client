    is the City of Trade. However, the Great Law of Trade only protects \"legitimate\"
    trade, trade that passes through the city''s sole gate, which the Red Plumes
    monitor and tax. And the Great Law of Humanity banishes non-humans from the city
    altogether. The two Great Laws create great demand and great risk for smugglers,
    who shepherd illicit goods and non-humans into and out of the city by secret
    routes. The Rogues Guild tightly controls all of this activity, taking its cut
    from sanctioned jobs and exacting punishment for independent jobs.","Perhaps
    you trafficked Dragon''s Breath (a brandy-like liquor) to avoid tariffs or contraband
    to avoid seizure, or maybe you are a human who sympathizes with the non-humans
    and worked as part of the network of secret routes and safe houses that helps
    them pass through Hillsfar. Either way, you have contacts in the smuggling community
    who can help you slip into and out of the city unnoticed, for a price."]},{"name":"Feature:

    the smuggling community to secure secret passage into or out of Hillsfar for
    yourself and your adventuring companions, no questions asked, and no Red Plume

    will be able to help on your timetable or at all. Your Dungeon Master will determine
    whether you can be smuggled into or out of the city. In return for your passage,
    you and your companions may owe the Rouges Guild a favor and/or may have to pay
