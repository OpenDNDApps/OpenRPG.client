    life is oriented around your participation in the five trials that will determine
    your worthiness in the afterlife. While you prepare for and undergo those trials,
    you have constant access to training. A comfortable place to live and regular
    meals are provided to you by servitor mummies (the anointed) under the supervision
    of viziers. You can enjoy these benefits only as long as you obey the societal
    norms of Naktamun\u2014training for the trials (with or without your crop), obeying
    the orders of the gods, and following the instructions of their viziers. If you
    violate these norms, you risk being treated as a dissenter. See \\\"Trials of
    the Five Gods\\\" for more information about undertaking the trials and their
    rewards.\",\"The five gods are the effective rulers of Amonkhet. They are not
    the creators of the plane, but they are its stewards while the people of Naktamun
    await the return of the God-Pharaoh. The five gods believe they were created
    by the God-Pharaoh, who charged them with teaching the people the ways of the
    God-Pharaoh, and with protecting them until he comes.\",\"The five gods embody
    the five virtues the God-Pharaoh wishes to cultivate in those who will become
    his Eternals in the afterlife. Each god is responsible for modeling and teaching
    one of those virtues to the acolytes and initiates of Naktamun, and then testing
    those initiates to ensure that they have mastered their teachings. Thus, they
    are present during the acolytes' first lessons, during the Ceremony of Measuring,
    during the initiates' intense training, and at each of the trials that are part
    of an initiate's journey.\",\"In the absence of the God-Pharaoh, only the gods
    can determine whether initiates have proven themselves worthy of the glory of
    the afterlife. The gods in turn prove their own worthiness by executing their
    duties infallibly. They make the trials as challenging as possible to ensure
    that only the most worthy are selected.\",{\"name\":\"Oketra (Solidarity Domain)\",\"type\":\"inset\",\"entries\":[\"\\\"The

    charged with expounding upon this teaching of the God-Pharaoh, instilling in
    every initiate the virtue of solidarity. She forges each group of children into
    a crop of acolytes with just one purpose: to be judged worthy of a glorious afterlife.
    And she instills in each crop the ability to unite in a single action in pursuit
    of that purpose. She is fond of poetic imagery to communicate her ideals.\"]},{\"name\":\"Kefnet

    by those who have proved by their wits that they are worthy of dwelling in the
    glorious presence of the God-Pharaoh. He trains acolytes and initiates to push
    their limits and challenge their mental capacity with spells of ever-greater

    would enter the afterlife\u2014but to his mind, the words themselves don't matter.
    Strength can't be taught. It must be built through practice and training. Rhonas
    demonstrates his teachings by his example, rather than by giving his students
    any kind of academic instruction. He welcomes the people of Naktamun to stand
    by the Hekma and watch him as he storms into the desert to battle the greatest
    horrors. He encourages them to observe his indomitable strength, for though they
    will never equal it, they can aspire to mimicry. He invites them to scrutinize
    every move and practice what they see.\"]},{\"name\":\"Bontu (Ambition Domain)\",\"type\":\"inset\",\"entries\":[\"\\\"The

    expends little effort in teaching it, she surely leads by example. Her viziers
    subtly plant the seeds that flower into the ambition the God-Pharaoh desires.
    Through insinuation, they remind acolytes and initiates alike that achieving
    one's place in the afterlife at the expense of others is not shameful, but is
    proof of the initiate's determination and drive. Nothing is more important than
    that drive, they suggest\u2014not the bonds of a crop, not friendship or love.
