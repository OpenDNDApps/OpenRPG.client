    and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting
    the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword
    in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.\",\"After
    tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back
    her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear
    that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow
    after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.\",\"Holding
    his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling
    the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the
    owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while
    he readies his bow.\",\"Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges
    that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed
    trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their
    unending watch.\",{\"type\":\"entries\",\"name\":\"Deadly Hunters\",\"entries\":[\"Warriors
    of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the
    edges of civilization\u2014humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities,
    terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator
    does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and
    rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly
    useful against their specific favored foes.\",\"Thanks to their familiarity with
    the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power,
    much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed,
    stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly
    focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.\"]},{\"type\":\"entries\",\"name\":\"Independent
    Adventurers\",\"entries\":[\"Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter,
    a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of
    civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from
    the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with
    druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing
    that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first\u2014and
    possibly the last\u2014line of defense.\",\"This fierce independence makes rangers
    well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts
    of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and
    whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement,
    frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who
    can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any
    extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find
    fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.\"]},{\"type\":\"entries\",\"name\":\"Creating
    a Ranger\",\"entries\":[\"As you create your ranger character, consider the nature
    of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with
    a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's
    ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain\u2014perhaps
    by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned
    your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained
    in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse
    who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature
    through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.\",\"What's the source of your
    particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you
    loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction
    these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is
    your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands,
    or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do
    you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome
    the relief from solitude that they offer?\",{\"type\":\"entries\",\"name\":\"Quick

    are free-minded wanderers and seekers who patrol the edges of civilized territory,
    turning back the denizens of the wild lands beyond. It is a thankless job, since
    their efforts are rarely understood and almost never rewarded. Yet rangers persist
    in their duties, never doubting that their work makes the world a safer place.\",\"A
    relationship with civilization informs every ranger's personality and history.
    Some rangers see themselves as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on
    civilization's frontier, answering to no sovereign power. Others are survivalists
    who eschew civilization altogether. They vanquish monsters to keep themselves
    safe while they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of the world.

    to tell the difference between one ranger and another. Indeed, to those who have
    seen them operate and been the beneficiaries of their prowess, it scarcely matters
    why rangers do what they do. That said, no two rangers are likely to express
    their opinions on any matter in the same way.\",\"If you haven't yet thought
