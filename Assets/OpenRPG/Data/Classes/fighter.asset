    two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind
    spot in its defenses.\",\"A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master

    smite him.\",\"All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class

    overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit

    Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword,
    use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a
    fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree
    of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate
    on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting
    their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and
    extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and

    dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.\",\"Some fighters feel drawn
    to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and
    other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter,
    not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater
    risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards\u2014few fighters in the city watch

    factors.\",\"You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a
    local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics,
    and military history. Or you might be self-taught\u2014unpolished but well tested.
    Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or
    are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons
    and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps
    you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your
    most important possessions\u2014the only things that stand between you and death's

    can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength

    in the worlds of D&D, the fighter is perhaps the greatest paradox. On the one
    hand, a singular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their craft
    in quite the same way; their weapons, armor, and tactics differ across a vast
    spectrum. On the other hand, regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at
    the heart of every fighter's motivation lies the same basic truth: it is better
    to wound than to be wounded.\",\"Although some adventuring fighters risk their
    lives fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily concerned with the
    welfare of others. They put more value on the well-being of the society, the
    village, or the group than on their own safety. Even if there's gold in the offing,
