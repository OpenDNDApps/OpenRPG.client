    of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait
    to roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a
    Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier).
    A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can''t hear or see you. On
    a failed save, a target becomes {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute.
    If the {@condition frightened} target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving
    throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."]}]}'
