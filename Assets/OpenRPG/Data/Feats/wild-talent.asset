    the Die''s Size","entries":["If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent
    die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning
    through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a {@dice d6} and you
    roll a 6, it becomes a {@dice d4}. If it''s a {@dice d4} and you roll a 4, it
    becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.","Conversely, if you roll a 1
    on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to
    its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use.
    For example, if you roll a 1 on a {@dice d4}, the die then becomes a {@dice d6}.","Whenever
    you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size.
    When you reach certain levels, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases:
    at 5th level ({@dice d8}), 11th level ({@dice d10}), and 17th level ({@dice d12}).
    If you have a Psionic Talent die from another source, such as a class feature,
