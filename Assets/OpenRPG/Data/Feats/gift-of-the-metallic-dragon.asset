    {@spell cure wounds} spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell
    slot. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can''t do so again until you
    finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have.
    The spell''s spellcasting ability is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma when you
    cast it with this feat (choose when you gain this feat).","You can manifest protective
    wings that can shield you or others from attacks. When you or another creature
    you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction
    to manifest spectral wings from your back for a moment. Roll a {@dice d4} and
    grant a bonus to the target''s AC equal to the number rolled against that attack
    roll, potentially causing it to miss. You can use this reaction a number of times
    equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish
    a long rest."]}]}'
