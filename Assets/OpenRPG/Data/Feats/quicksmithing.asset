    have mastered the art of on-the-fly invention, improvement, and jury-rigging.
    You can use your talents to create immediate, short-term magical effects similar

    feat, you master two magical effects, each of which recreates the effect of a
    1st-level spell that has the ritual tag. These spells can come from any class
    list, but Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for them.","If you come across
    a schematic geared toward quicksmithing or study with another quicksmith, you
    might be able to add another spell to the effects you have mastered. The spell''s
    level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the
    ritual tag. The process of mastering the spell takes 2 hours per level of the
    spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents aether you use as you experiment
    with the spell effect to master it.","In addition, you have proficiency with

    hour repairing it to keep it functioning. You can use your action to dismantle
