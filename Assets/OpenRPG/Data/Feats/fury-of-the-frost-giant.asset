    to retaliate with a conjured blast of ice. The creature must make a Constitution
    saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability
    increased by this feat). On a failed save, it takes {@damage 1d8} + your proficiency
    bonus cold damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. You
    can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and
    you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest."]}]}]}'
