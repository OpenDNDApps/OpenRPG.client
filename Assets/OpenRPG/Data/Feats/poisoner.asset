    number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus. Once applied,
    the poison retains potency for 1 minute, or until you hit with the weapon. When
    a weapon coated in this poison deals damage to a creature, that creature must
    succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 2d8} poison damage
    and become {@condition poisoned} until the end of your next turn."]}]}'
