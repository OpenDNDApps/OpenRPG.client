  Title: Lucky
  AsJson: '{"name":"Lucky","source":"PHB","page":167,"entries":["You have inexplicable
    luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.","You have 3 luck points.
    Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can
    spend one luck point to roll an additional {@dice d20}. You can choose to spend
    one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined.
    You choose which of the {@dice d20}s is used for the attack roll, ability check,
    or saving throw.","You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made
    against you. Roll a {@dice d20}, and then choose whether the attack uses the
    attacker''s roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence
    the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are
    rolled.","You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest."]}'
