    reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra {@damage 1d8} piercing
    damage, or an extra {@damage 1d10} piercing damage if you wield the spear with
    two hands. You can''t use this ability if the creature used the {@action Disengage}
    action before moving.","As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your
