    more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the {@spell detect magic}
    spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn
    {@spell levitate} and {@spell dispel magic}, each of which you can cast once
    without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells
    in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability
    for all three spells."]}'
