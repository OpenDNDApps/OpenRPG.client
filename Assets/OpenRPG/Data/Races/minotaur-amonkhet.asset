    develop more slowly than humans, reaching full maturity around the age of 20.
    They typically become acolytes at around 8 or 9 years old, making them among
    the older members of their crops. Once they reach maturity, though, minotaurs
    age quickly, rushing headlong through the trials (as they do all aspects of life)
    to complete them before they pass their peak. A minotaur allowed to die of old
    age would rarely live beyond 40."]},{"name":"Alignment","type":"entries","entries":["Most
