    you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and
    physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check.
    Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street
    thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle
    to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision."]}'
