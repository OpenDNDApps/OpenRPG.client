    Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence
    of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the
    keenness of your senses.","For example, you might try to hear a conversation
    through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving
    stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or
    easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in
    the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door."]}'
