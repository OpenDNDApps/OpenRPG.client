    you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make
    an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden
    object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it,
    or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring
    through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also
    call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check."]}'
