    throw or take on a new form as if affected by the {@spell polymorph} spell. The
    creature''s new form is a random beast or a creature it has seen within the last
    24 hours (as chosen by the DM). This transformation lasts until the end of the
    target''s next long rest. This effect is not subject to {@spell dispel magic}
    or {@spell remove curse}, but a {@spell greater restoration} spell restores the
    creature to its original form."],"poisonTypes":["ingested","injury"],"attachedSpells":["polymorph"]}'
