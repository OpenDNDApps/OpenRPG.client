  Title: Weird Tank
  AsJson: '{"name":"Weird Tank","source":"PotA","page":223,"rarity":"rare","reqAttune":true,"wondrous":true,"entries":["A
    weird tank is a ten-gallon tank of blown glass and sculpted bronze with a backpack-like
    carrying harness fashioned from tough leather. A {@creature water weird} is contained
    within the tank. While wearing the tank, you can use an action to open it, allowing
    the {@creature water weird} to emerge. The {@creature water weird} acts immediately
    after you in the initiative order, and it is bound to the tank.","You can command
    the {@creature water weird} telepathically (no action required) while you wear
    the tank. You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded
    the {@creature water weird} to retract into it or if the {@creature water weird}
    is dead.","If the {@creature water weird} is killed, the tank loses its magical
    containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water
    node. When the tank is recharged, a new {@creature water weird} forms inside
    it.","The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage,
    and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points
    destroys it and the {@creature water weird} contained within it."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
