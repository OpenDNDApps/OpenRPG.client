    rank 2, you gain the use of a weathered leather pouch that is an uncommon magic
    item. The portfolio keeper holds and organizes notes, brochures, and business
    cards bearing your contact information. It also has an inexhaustible supply of
    brochures related to your franchise''s current branding scheme.","When you meet
    someone for the first time, their details and a rough sketch are magically stored
    on a small parchment card in the portfolio keeper. You can access the details
    of any such stored card as a bonus action.",{"type":"entries","name":"Cards of
    Sending","entries":["At rank 3, the power of your portfolio keeper becomes more
    potent, making it a rare magic item. When you give out a business card stored
    in your portfolio keeper, you can choose to have the card allow its recipient
    to contact you through your {@item sending stone|AI} as if they had cast a {@spell
    sending} spell. A business card loses this power seven days after it has been
    given out, and no more than five cards can have this power at one time.","You
    can also use your {@item sending stone|AI} to cast {@spell sending} and contact
    anyone who has one of your business cards. Once you use this feature of the stone,
    you cannot use it again until dawn seven days later."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Charming

    to keep a potential customer''s attention. When you provide a humanoid with a
    business card from your portfolio keeper, you can cast {@spell charm person}

    card."]}],"attachedSpells":["sending","charm person"]}'
