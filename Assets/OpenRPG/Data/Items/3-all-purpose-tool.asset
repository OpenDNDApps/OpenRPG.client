    of {@item artisan''s tools|PHB}). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient

    and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells.","As an action, you can focus
    on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don''t
    know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts
    as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can''t be used
    again until the next dawn."]}'
