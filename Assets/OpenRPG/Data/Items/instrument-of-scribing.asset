    musical instrument has 3 charges. While you are playing it, you can use an action
    to expend 1 charge from the instrument and write a magical message on a nonmagical
    object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of you. The message can be
    up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a bard,
    you can scribe an additional seven words and choose to make the message glow
    faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical darkness. Casting {@spell dispel
    magic} on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.","The
    instrument regains all expended charges daily at dawn."]}'
