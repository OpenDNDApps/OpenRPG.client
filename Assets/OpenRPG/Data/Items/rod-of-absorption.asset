  Title: Rod of Absorption
  AsJson: "{\"name\":\"Rod of Absorption\",\"source\":\"DMG\",\"page\":195,\"srd\":true,\"type\":\"RD\",\"tier\":\"major\",\"rarity\":\"very
    rare\",\"reqAttune\":true,\"weight\":2,\"entries\":[\"While holding this rod,
    you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not
    with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's
    energy\u2014not the spell itself\u2014is stored in the rod. The energy has the
    same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to
    50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50
    levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the
    rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\",\"When you become attuned
    to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the
    course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has
    stored.\",\"If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy
    stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can
    create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots,
    up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots,
    but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored
    in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.\",\"A newly found rod has {@dice 1d10}
    levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb
    spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\"],\"lootTables\":[\"Magic
