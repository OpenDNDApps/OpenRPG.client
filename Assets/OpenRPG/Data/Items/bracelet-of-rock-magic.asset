    you wear this gold bracelet, it grants you immunity to being {@condition petrified},

    Once the spell has been cast three times, the bracelet can no longer cast it.
    Thereafter, you can cast {@spell stone shape} as an action. After you have done
    this thirteen times, the bracelet loses its magic and turns from gold to lead.",{"type":"entries","name":"Curse","entries":["The
    bracelet''s affinity with earth manifests as an unusual curse. Creatures of flesh
    that are strongly related to earth and stone, such as stone giants and dwarves,
    have advantage on the saving throw against {@spell flesh to stone} cast from
    the bracelet. If such a creature''s save is successful, the bracelet breaks your
    attunement to it and casts the spell on you. You make your saving throw with
