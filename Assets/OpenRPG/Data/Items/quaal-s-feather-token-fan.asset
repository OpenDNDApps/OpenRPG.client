    you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet
    in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The
    fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing
    its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action."]}]}'
