  Title: Sphere of Annihilation
  AsJson: "{\"name\":\"Sphere of Annihilation\",\"source\":\"DMG\",\"page\":201,\"srd\":true,\"tier\":\"major\",\"rarity\":\"legendary\",\"wondrous\":true,\"entries\":[\"This
    2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and
    stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.\",\"The sphere obliterates all
    matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are
    the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation,
    it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere
    but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes {@damage 4d10} force damage.\",\"The
    sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of
    an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill
    Arcana}) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice,
    up to a number of feet equal to 5 \xD7 your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5
    feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space
    the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched
    by it, taking {@damage 4d10} force damage.\",\"If you attempt to control a sphere
    that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana})
    check contested by the other creature's Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check.
    The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as
    normal.\",\"If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that
    created by the {@spell gate} spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that
    within a {@item portable hole}, the DM determines randomly what happens, using
    the following table.\",{\"type\":\"table\",\"colLabels\":[\"{@dice d100}\",\"Result\"],\"colStyles\":[\"col-1

    the sphere, to a random plane of existence.\"]]}],\"lootTables\":[\"Magic Item
