    psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage, essence
    of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to help manage pain during
    the Last War, it''s now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily
    isn''t illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it''s heavily taxed, and thus
    most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can
    be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria
    and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects
    of dreamlily is {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. While {@condition poisoned}
    in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0
    hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A
    dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through
    legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration
    or the price might vary accordingly."]}'
