    (magic)","entries":["A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which
    is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other
    wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and
    transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees
    if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit
    point, and {@sense darkvision} with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed,
    each coven member takes {@damage 3d10} psychic damage and is {@condition blinded}
    for 24 hours.","A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating
    a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual
    takes 1 hour, and the hags can''t perform it while {@condition blinded}. During
    the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they
    must start over."]}'
