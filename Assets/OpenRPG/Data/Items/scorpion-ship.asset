    ships are archaic metal warships that have never lost their popularity, largely
    because of their versatility. Articulated legs enable a scorpion ship to land
    safely on the ground and move across a solid surface at a walking speed of 30
    feet. The ship can''t float on water, however. A ballista is mounted on the top
    deck, and a mangonel is perched on the end of the tail. The ship''s two claws
    are relatively inefficient in combat, but a claw that grabs a creature can quickly
    take it out of action."],"seeAlsoVehicle":["Scorpion Ship|AAG"]}'
