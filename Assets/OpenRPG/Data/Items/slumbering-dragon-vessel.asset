    vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold

    word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil,
    a {@item potion of healing}, or a {@item potion of climbing}. Once this property
    is used, it can''t be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way
    loses its magical properties if it isn''t imbibed within 24 hours."]}'
