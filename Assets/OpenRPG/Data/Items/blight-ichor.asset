  Title: Blight Ichor

    bitter chartreuse concoction is distilled from a fungus native to the Blightshore
    badlands. The sickly green liqueur harbors potent psychedelic properties. Provided
    it is neither a construct nor undead, a creature subjected to a dose of blight
    ichor gains advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks, as well as vulnerability
    to psychic damage, for 1 hour. For each dose of blight ichor consumed, the creature
    must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned}
    for {@dice 1d6} hours and suffer the effects of a {@spell confusion} spell for
    1 minute. An undead creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage
    on all Dexterity checks and is immune to the {@condition frightened} condition
    for 1 hour."]}'
