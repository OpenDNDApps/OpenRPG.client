    common wondrous item is a hollow, 5-inch-diameter orb that weighs 5 pounds. Its
    outer shell is composed of notched bronze rings, which can be turned so that
    the notches line up. Aligning the notches requires an action, and doing so causes
    the orb to gong loudly until the notches are no longer aligned. The sounds are
    spaced 6 seconds apart and can be heard out to a range of 600 feet."]}'
