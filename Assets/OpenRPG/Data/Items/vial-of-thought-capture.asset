  Title: Vial of Thought Capture
  AsJson: '{"name":"Vial of Thought Capture","source":"AZfyT","page":4,"rarity":"unknown
    (magic)","entries":["This dark blue vial allows you to read another''s surface
    thoughts and capture them as thought strands, storing the strands within the
    vial. As an action, you can activate the vial to target a creature you can see
    within 10 feet of you to learn its surface thoughts and pull the thoughts learned
    out of the creature''s head as a tangible glowing string of energy known as a
    thought strand. The strands can be stored in the vial for up to 24 hours or until
    the vial reaches capacity, in which case the oldest strands dissipate. A creature
    affected by the vial knows that its thoughts are being probed.","The vial can
    also store thought strands created by the {@spell encode thoughts|ggr} cantrip.
    It does not extend the duration of those strands beyond 8 hours, but stored strands
    do not disappear if you cast {@spell encode thoughts|ggr} again during the duration
    of the cantrip.","The vial has 3 charges and can store up to 3 thought strands.
    It regains all its charges daily at dusk."]}'
