  Title: Bag of Devouring
  AsJson: '{"name":"Bag of Devouring","source":"DMG","page":153,"srd":true,"tier":"minor","rarity":"very
    rare","wondrous":true,"weight":15,"entries":["This bag superficially resembles
    a {@item bag of holding} but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional
    creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.","The extradimensional
    creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal
    or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When
    part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches
    inside it, there is a {@chance 50} chance that the creature is pulled inside
    the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a
    successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach
    into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength
    check (provided it isn''t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts
    its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.","Inanimate objects
    can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However,
    once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into
    another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.","If the bag
    is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported
    to a random location on the Astral Plane."],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table D"],"hasFluffImages":true}'
