    As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or
    a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends.
    You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.","When
    you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard,
    you can momentarily curse one creature targeted by the spell; choose one ability

    ability checks and saving throws that use that ability."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
