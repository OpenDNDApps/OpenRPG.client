  Title: Mirror of the Past
  AsJson: '{"name":"Mirror of the Past","source":"TftYP","page":228,"rarity":"rare","wondrous":true,"weight":1,"entries":["The
    holder of this platinum hand mirror can learn something about the history of
    a specific object or creature by taking an action to gaze into the mirror and
    think of the target. Instead of the holder''s reflection, the mirror presents
    scenes from the target''s past. Information conveyed is accurate, but it is random
    and cryptic, and presented in no particular order. Once it is activated, the
    mirror gives its information for 1 minute or less, then returns to normal. It
    can''t be used again until the next dawn."]}'
