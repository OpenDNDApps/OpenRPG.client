  Title: Orzhov Keyrune
  AsJson: '{"name":"Orzhov Keyrune","source":"GGR","page":178,"rarity":"rare","reqAttune":"by
    a member of the Orzhov guild","reqAttuneTags":[{"background":"orzhov representative|ggr"}],"wondrous":true,"entries":["This
    keyrune is carved from white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped like
    a thrull''s head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On command, the keyrune transforms
    into a {@creature winged thrull|GGR} for up to 2 hours. If you don''t come from
    an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements
    and mannerisms while carrying out your orders.","When you use an action to speak
    the item''s command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied
    space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a {@creature winged thrull|GGR}.
    If there isn''t enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn''t transform.","The
    creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild
    (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages
    and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes
    the {@action Dodge} action and moves to avoid danger.","At the end of the duration,
    the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit
    points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching
    it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can''t transform again
    until 36 hours have passed."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
