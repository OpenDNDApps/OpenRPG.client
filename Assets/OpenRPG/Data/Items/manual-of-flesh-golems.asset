    rare","wondrous":true,"weight":5,"entries":["This tome contains information and
    incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The DM chooses the
    type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a
    spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can''t use
    a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes {@damage 6d6} psychic damage.","To
    create a {@creature flesh golem}, you must spend 60 days, working without interruption
    with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also
    pay 50,000 gp to purchase supplies. Once you finish creating the golem, the book
    is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the
    manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and
    obeys your spoken commands."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
