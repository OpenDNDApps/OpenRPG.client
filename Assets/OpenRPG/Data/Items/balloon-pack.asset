  Title: Balloon Pack
  AsJson: '{"name":"Balloon Pack","source":"PotA","page":222,"rarity":"uncommon","wondrous":true,"entries":["This
    backpack contains the spirit of an {@creature air elemental} and a compact leather
    balloon. While you''re wearing the backpack, you can deploy the balloon as an
    action and gain the effect of the {@spell levitate} spell for 10 minutes, targeting
    yourself and requiring no concentration. Alternatively, you can use a reaction
    to deploy the balloon when you''re falling and gain the effect of the {@spell
    feather fall} spell for yourself.","When either spell ends, the balloon slowly
    deflates as the elemental spirit escapes and returns to the Elemental Plane of
    Air. As the balloon deflates, you descend gently toward the ground for up to
    60 feet. If you are still in the air at the end of this distance, you fall if
    you have no other means of staying aloft.","After the spirit departs, the backpack''s
    property is unusable unless the backpack is recharged for 1 hour in an elemental
    air node, which binds another spirit to the backpack."],"attachedSpells":["levitate","feather
    fall"]}'
