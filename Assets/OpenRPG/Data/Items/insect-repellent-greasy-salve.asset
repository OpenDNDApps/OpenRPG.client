  Title: Insect Repellent (greasy salve)
  AsJson: '{"name":"Insect Repellent (greasy salve)","source":"ToA","page":32,"type":"G","rarity":"none","value":100,"charges":20,"entries":["Insect
    repellent can be purchased in Port Nyanzaru in two forms: blocks of incense or
    a greasy salve. The merchant prince Kwayothe controls the sale of both. Neither
    kind of repellent protects against giant insects or the vile swarms of insects
    described in appendix A of the Monster Manual.","A gourd or vial of salve contains
    20 applications of odorless grease. One application protects its wearer against
    normal insects for 24 hours. The salve is waterproof so it doesn''t wash off
    in rain."]}'
