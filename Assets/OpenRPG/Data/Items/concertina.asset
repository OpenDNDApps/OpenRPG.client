  AsJson: '{"name":"Concertina","source":"RMBRE","page":26,"rarity":"rare","wondrous":true,"entries":["A
    concertina is a less charming kind of accordion.","In addition to knocking out
    a killer polka, a creature playing the concertina can use an action to cause
    an area of mist or water up to 30 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep to freeze
    solid.","Once used, this feature of the concertina can''t be used again until
    the next dawn.","Any creatures touching the floor must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity
    saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the ice. As an action, a {@condition
    restrained} creature can attempt to free itself or another creature within its
    reach from the ice, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength ({@skill Athletics})
    check. A character freed from the ice is no longer {@condition restrained} by
    it. The ice melts in an hour."]}'
