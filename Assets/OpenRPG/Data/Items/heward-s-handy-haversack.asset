    backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional
    space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a
    volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or
    80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its
    contents.","Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting
    with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action.
    When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically
    on top.","The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp
    object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the
    haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always
    turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents
    spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used
    again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can
    survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.","Placing
    the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item bag of holding},
    {@item portable hole}, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens
    a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed
    inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it
    and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.
