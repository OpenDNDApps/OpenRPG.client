  Title: Scroll of Protection from Undead
  AsJson: '{"name":"Scroll of Protection from Undead","source":"DMG","page":199,"type":"SC","tier":"minor","rarity":"rare","entries":["Using
    an action to read the scroll encloses you in an {@condition invisible} barrier
    that extends from you to form a 5-foot-radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes,
    this barrier prevents undead from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder.
    The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move
    in such a way that an undead would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends. A
    creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC
    15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier."]}'
