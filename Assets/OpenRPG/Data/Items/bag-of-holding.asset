  Title: Bag of Holding
  AsJson: '{"name":"Bag of Holding","source":"DMG","page":153,"srd":true,"basicRules":true,"tier":"minor","rarity":"uncommon","wondrous":true,"weight":15,"entries":["This
    bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly
    2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds,
    not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless
    of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.","If the
    bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents
    are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents
    spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again.
    Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal
    to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time
    they begin to suffocate.","Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional
    space created by a {@item Heward''s handy haversack}, {@item portable hole},
    or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral
    Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
    creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location
    on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can''t
    be reopened."],"containerCapacity":{"weight":[500],"weightless":true},"optionalfeatures":["replicate
