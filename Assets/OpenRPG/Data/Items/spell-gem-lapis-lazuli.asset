    lapis lazuli spell gem can contain one spell from any class''s spell list. You
    become aware of the spell when you learn the gem''s properties. While holding

    from the gem with no other effect.","A lapis lazuli spell gem can store up to

    to it and it''s empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The
    spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must
    require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell''s level must be
    no higher than the gem''s maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration
    and requires material components that are consumed, you must provide them, but
