  Title: Dragon's Blood
  AsJson: '{"name":"Dragon''s Blood","source":"ERLW","page":244,"type":"OTH","rarity":"none","entries":["Introduced
    into Sharn by Daask, dragon''s blood is a potent and highly addictive stimulant.
    In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even
    temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug''s
    effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn''t something
    a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere
    with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a {@spell
    fireball} in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon''s blood are up
    to you, but you can take inspiration from the {@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB} table
    in the {@book Player''s Handbook|PHB}."]}'
