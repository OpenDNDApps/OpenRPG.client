    this stuffed doll is within 5 feet of you, you can spend a short rest telling
    it to say up to six phrases, none of which can be more than six words long, and
    set an observable condition under which the doll speaks each phrase. You can
    also replace old phrases with new ones. Whatever the condition, it must occur
    within 5 feet of the doll to make it speak. For example, whenever someone picks
    up the doll, it might say, \"I want a piece of candy.\" The doll''s phrases are
    lost when your attunement to the doll ends."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
