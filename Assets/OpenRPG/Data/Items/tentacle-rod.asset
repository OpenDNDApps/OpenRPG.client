    by the {@creature drow}, this rod is a magic weapon that ends in three rubbery
    tentacles. While holding the rod, you can use an action to direct each tentacle
    to attack a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Each tentacle makes a
    melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. On a hit, the tentacle deals {@damage 1d6}
    bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make
    a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature''s speed is halved,
    it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can''t use reactions for
    1 minute. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus
    action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving
    throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."],"lootTables":["Magic Item
