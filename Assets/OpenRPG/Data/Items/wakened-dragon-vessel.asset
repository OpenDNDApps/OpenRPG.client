    vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold
    a liquid.","As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command
    word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil,
    mead, wine, a {@item potion of healing}, a {@item potion of greater healing},
    a {@item potion of superior healing}, a {@item potion of climbing}, a {@item
    potion of fire breath}, or a {@item potion of flying}. Once this property is
    used, it can''t be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way
    loses its magical properties if it isn''t imbibed within 24 hours."]}'
