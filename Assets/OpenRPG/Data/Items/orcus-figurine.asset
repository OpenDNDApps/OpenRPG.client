    from an ogre''s {@condition petrified} heart, the gray figurine depicts the Demon
    Prince of Undeath in ghastly detail, clutching his skull-topped wand in one hand
    and three severed heads by the hair in the other. The figurine smells like decaying
    flesh, and this scent is detectable out to a range of 5 feet.","The figurine
    is a Tiny object with AC 17, 3 hit points, and immunity to all types of damage
    except radiant damage. A {@spell detect evil and good} spell or similar magic
    reveals that the figurine has been desecrated. As long as it has at least 1 hit
    point, the figurine has the following magical properties:",{"type":"list","items":["Undead

    of the figurine can''t be brought back to life.","A creature that holds the figurine
    while praying to Orcus for at least 1 hour has a {@chance 10|10 percent} chance
    of summoning a smoky avatar of the demon lord. Once this avatar is summoned,
    it can''t be summoned again for 30 days. Orcus''s avatar has the statistics of
    a {@creature wraith} except that it''s chaotic evil. It attacks all non-undead
    creatures it encounters, and it disappears after 1 hour or when reduced to 0
