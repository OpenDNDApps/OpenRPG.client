    backpack-sized device holds a balloon-based parachute. If you fall while wearing
    this device, you can use your reaction to deploy the parachute. Once deployed,
    the parachute rapidly inflates, and you descend 60 feet per round and take no
    damage from falling. When you are 10 feet away from the ground, roll a {@dice
