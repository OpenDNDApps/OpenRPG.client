    and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics
    of a {@creature roc}, but it obeys your simple commands and can''t attack. It
    can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour
    for a maximum of 144 miles per day. with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of
    flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying
    its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss
    the bird as an action."]}]}'
