    rare","entries":["A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written as
    a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class''s spell list, you can read
    the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise,
    the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires
    the spell''s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll
    fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not
    lost.","If the spell is on your class''s spell list but of a higher level than
    you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting
    ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC is 18. On a failed
    check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.","Once the
    spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to
    dust.","A spell cast from this scroll has a save DC of 18 and an attack bonus
    of {@hit 10}.","A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells
    in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the
    copier must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. If the check
    succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails,
    the spell scroll is destroyed."],"spellScrollLevel":8,"lootTables":["Magic Item
