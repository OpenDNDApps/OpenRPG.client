  Title: Constantori's Portrait

    painting by famed artist Dkesii Kwan depicts Constantori, a beautiful courtier,
    who was paid a staggering sum to be Dkesii's model. Whether Constantori's actual
    appearance matches the painting remains a subject of debate. The portrait is
    one of several paintings commissioned by the late Daiyani Grysthorn, a crime
    lord who frequently gave magical paintings as gifts to her most esteemed associates.\",{\"type\":\"entries\",\"name\":\"Sentience\",\"entries\":[\"Constantori's
    Portrait is a sentient, lawful evil item with an Intelligence score of 14, a
    Wisdom score of 12, and a Charisma score of 8. It can hear within a range of
    120 feet and has {@sense darkvision} within a range of 60 feet, but it can't
    see anything behind itself.\",\"The painting can converse in Common, Draconic,
    and Elvish as if it were a living person, though Constantori's mouth doesn't
    move. Whenever conversation occurs within the portrait's auditory range, the
    painting eagerly gathers secrets, the names of secret tellers, significant events,
    or any political conversations.\"]},{\"type\":\"entries\",\"name\":\"Personality\",\"entries\":[\"Constantori's
    Portrait is demanding, condescending, and vain. It doesn't like being covered
    or placed out of sight, and it loudly condemns anyone who tries to remove it
    from its gold-leaf frame.\"]},{\"type\":\"entries\",\"name\":\"Wealth of Information\",\"entries\":[\"The
    painting's primary purpose is to observe and recall conversations. Over the past
    few decades, Constantori's Portrait has quietly observed countless conversations
    and now possesses an unquantifiable amount of lore\u2014everything from criminal
    conspiracies to secret passwords. The DM decides what the painting knows and
    what it doesn't.\",\"While attuned to the painting, you can take an action to
    telepathically contact it over any distance, provided you and the painting are
    on the same plane of existence. The painting can't telepathically contact you,
    however. Maintaining telepathic contact with the painting requires your concentration
    (as if concentrating on a spell).\"]},{\"type\":\"entries\",\"name\":\"Guardian

    it to guard its location against one or more creatures you identify as the painting's
    enemies. The painting performs this function until you command it to stop or
    until your attunement to the painting ends.\",\"The painting has 3 charges. When
    a creature the painting identifies as its enemy starts its turn in a space the
    painting can see, the painting expends 1 of its charges to cast {@spell magic
    missile} (3 missiles), targeting that creature. The painting regains all expended
    charges daily at dawn.\",\"The painting is a Small object with AC 12, 20 hit
    points, and immunity to poison damage. In its gold-leaf frame, the painting weighs
    15 pounds. If the painting has at least 1 hit point and is targeted by a {@spell
