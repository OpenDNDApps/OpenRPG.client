    you attune to this staff, you transform into a goat-humanoid hybrid over the
    course of 3 days. Tieflings are immune to this curse. Throughout the first day,
    shaggy fur begins to grow all over your body. After 24 hours, your eyes become
    goat-like, and stumpy horns sprout from your brow. On the last day, your fingers
    and toes meld into double digits, and the horns grow to full length. This transformation
    doesn''t prevent you from wielding weapons or casting spells. {@spell Remove
    curse}, {@spell greater restoration}, or any other effect that ends a curse restores
    your original appearance, but only a {@spell wish} spell can rid the staff of
    its power to transform those who attune to it."}}},"curse":true}'
