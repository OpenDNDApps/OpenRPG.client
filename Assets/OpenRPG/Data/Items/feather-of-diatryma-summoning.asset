  Title: Feather of Diatryma Summoning
  AsJson: '{"name":"Feather of Diatryma Summoning","source":"WDH","page":191,"rarity":"rare","reqAttune":true,"wondrous":true,"entries":["This
    bright plume is made from the feather of a {@creature diatryma|wdh} (pronounced
    dee-ah-TRY-mah), a Large, colorful, flightless bird native to the Underdark.
    If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the feather into a Large
    unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you, the feather becomes a living
    diatryma for up to 6 hours, after which it reverts to its feather form. It reverts
    to feather form early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to
    speak the command word again while touching the bird.","When the diatryma reverts
    to feather form, the magic of the feather can''t be used again until 7 days have
    passed.","The diatryma uses the statistics of an {@creature axe beak}, except
    that its beak deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage. The creature
    is friendly to you and your companions, and it can be used as a mount. It understands
    your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the
    diatryma defends itself but takes no other actions."]}'
