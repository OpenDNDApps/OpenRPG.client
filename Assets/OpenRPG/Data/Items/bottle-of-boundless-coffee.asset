  Title: Bottle of Boundless Coffee
  AsJson: '{"name":"Bottle of Boundless Coffee","source":"SCC","page":38,"rarity":"common","wondrous":true,"entries":["This
    metal bottle carries delicious, warm coffee. The bottle comes with a stopper,
    which is attached to the bottle by a little chain. Even when open, the bottle
    won''t accept any liquid other than the coffee it produces. The coffee inside
    is always comfortably warm, and none of the heat can be felt through the bottle.","Each
    time you drink the coffee, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the bottle refuses to
    dispense coffee for the next hour. If you pour coffee from the bottle, rather
    than drinking from it, the coffee vanishes the moment it leaves the bottle."]}'
