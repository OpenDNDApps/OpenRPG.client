  Title: Tome of the Stilled Tongue

    thick leather-bound volume has a desiccated tongue pinned to the front cover.
    Five of these tomes exist, and it''s unknown which one is the original. The grisly
    cover decoration on the first tome of the stilled tongue once belonged to a treacherous
    former servant of the lich-god Vecna, keeper of secrets. The tongues pinned to
    the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters who crossed Vecna.
    The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The
    remaining pages are blank and pristine.","If you can attune to this item, you
    can use it as a spellbook and an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the
    tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell you have written in this tome,
    without expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic component. Once
    used, this property of the tome can''t be used again until the next dawn.","While
    attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book''s cover. If you
    do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.","Vecna watches
    anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in the book. These
    messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read."],"lootTables":["Magic
