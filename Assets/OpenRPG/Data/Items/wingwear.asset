  Title: Wingwear

    snug uniform has symbols of air stitched into it and leathery flaps that stretch
    along the arms, waist, and legs to create wings for gliding. A suit of wingwear
    has 3 charges. While you wear the suit, you can use a bonus action and expend
    1 charge to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until you land. At the end of each
    of your turns, your altitude drops by 5 feet. Your altitude drops instantly to
    0 feet at the end of your turn if you didn''t fly at least 30 feet horizontally
    on that turn. When your altitude drops to 0 feet, you land (or fall), and you
    must expend another charge to use the suit again.","The suit regains all of its
    expended charges after spending at least 1 hour in an elemental air node."]}'
