    whip, but attack rolls made against aberrations with this weapon have disadvantage.
    A creature hit by this weapon takes an extra {@damage 1d6} psychic damage. When
    you roll a 20 on the {@dice d20} for an attack roll with this weapon, the target
    is {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn.","As a bonus action,
    you can sheathe the whip by causing it to retract into your arm, or draw the
    whip out of your arm again.",{"type":"entries","name":"Symbiotic Nature","entries":["The
