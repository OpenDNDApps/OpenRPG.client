    an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area.
    Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
    or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least
    1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through
    the area at half speed doesn''t need to make the saving throw."],"packContents":[{"item":"caltrop|phb","quantity":20}],"atomicPackContents":true}'
