    carve tyrant ships out of stone using their disintegration rays and use these
    ships to wander the Astral Plane, looking for worlds to conquer and rival beholders

    reminiscent of their creators, such as a bulbous shape and eyestalks.","A spherical
    chamber on the ship''s command deck functions as a spelljamming helm that only
    beholders can attune to. Any beholder that occupies this chamber can attune to
    it. Reducing a tyrant ship to 0 hit points not only destroys it but also destroys
    the ship''s spelljamming helm and eyestalk cannons.","A tyrant ship can''t float
