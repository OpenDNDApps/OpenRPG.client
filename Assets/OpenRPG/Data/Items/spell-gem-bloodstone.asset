    bloodstone spell gem can contain one spell from any class''s spell list. You
    become aware of the spell when you learn the gem''s properties. While holding

    check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully.

    from the gem with no other effect.","A bloodstone spell gem can store up to 3rd
    level spells. Spells cast from the spell gem have a save DC of 15 and an attack
    bonus of {@hit 7}.","You can imbue the gem with a spell if you''re attuned to
    it and it''s empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell
    is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require
    either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell''s level must be no higher
    than the gem''s maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and
    requires material components that are consumed, you must provide them, but they
    can be worth half as much as normal.","Once imbued with a spell, the gem can''t
