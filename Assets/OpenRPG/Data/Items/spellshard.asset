  Title: Spellshard
  AsJson: '{"name":"Spellshard","source":"ERLW","page":279,"otherSources":[{"source":"UAWGE","page":115}],"rarity":"common","wondrous":true,"entries":["This
    polished Eberron dragonshard fits in the hand and stores information similar
    to a book. The shard can hold the equivalent of one book that''s no more than
    320 pages long. A shard can be created blank or already filled with information.
    When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken
    to access the information stored within.","While holding the shard, you can use
    an action to open your mind to the shard, seeing its content in your mind. On
    subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing new text on blank \"pages\" in
    the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and takes the
    same amount of time it takes you to read and write normally. Thinking of a particular
    phrase or topic draws you to the first section in the shard that addresses it.","A
    wizard can use a spellshard as a spellbook, with the usual cost in gold and time
    to \"scribe\" a spell into the shard."]}'
