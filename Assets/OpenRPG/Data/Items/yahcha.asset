    yahcha (pronounced YAH-chah) is a harmless, meaty beetle about the size of a
    human hand, which feeds on worms and maggots. It moves slowly (walking speed
    10 feet) and is easy to catch. A creature with blue mist fever that eats a raw
    or cooked yahcha can immediately make a saving throw with advantage against that
    disease (see \"Diseases,\" page 40),"]}'
