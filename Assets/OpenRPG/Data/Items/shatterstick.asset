    shatterstick is a nonmagical, 12-inch-long, 4-pound stake made of blue-tinged
    infernal iron mined on Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells. When embedded
    in earth or pounded into solid rock, the stake emits a seismic vibration in a
    20-foot radius centered on itself for 1 minute, shaking the ground in that area
    for the duration. When the effects ends, the shatterstick breaks apart, becoming
    useless, and all structures within 20 feet of it take 35 ({@damage 10d6}) bludgeoning
    damage."]}'
