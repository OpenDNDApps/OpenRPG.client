  Title: Tangler Grenade
  AsJson: '{"name":"Tangler Grenade","source":"WDMM","page":244,"type":"OTH","rarity":"none","entries":["A
    tangler grenade is an alchemical, nonmagical item with an ovoid resin shell that
    shatters on impact. An as action, a creature can throw a tangler grenade at a
    point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 10 feet of a shattered tangler
    grenade must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition restrained}
    by sticky white webs. As an action, a creature can try to free itself or another
    creature within its reach from the webs, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength
    ({@skill Athletics}) check. A gallon of alcohol dissolves the webs produced by
    a single tangler grenade. Otherwise, the webs dissolve on their own after 1 hour,
    freeing any creatures {@condition restrained} by them."]}'
