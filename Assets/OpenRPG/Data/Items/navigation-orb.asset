    navigation orb is a hollow, 7-foot-diameter sphere of thin, polished mithral
    with a large skye (cloud) rune embossed on its outer surface. The orb levitates
    10 feet above the ground and is keyed to a particular cloud castle, allowing
    you to control that castle''s altitude and movement while the orb is inside the
    castle. If the orb is destroyed or removed from its castle, the castle''s altitude
    and location remain fixed until the orb is returned or replaced.","As an action,
    you can cause one of the following effects to occur if you are touching the orb:","The
    castle moves at a speed of 1 mph in a straight line, in a direction of your choice,
    until the castle stops or is made to stop, or until another action is used to
    change its direction. If this movement brings the castle into contact with the
    ground, the castle lands gently.","The castle, if it is moving, comes to a gradual
    stop.","The castle makes a slow, 90-degree turn clockwise or counterclockwise
    (turning a northerly view into a westerly view, for example). The castle can
    turn while it is moving in a straight line.","Any creature touching the orb knows
    the altitude of the base of the castle above the ground or water below it."]}'
