    keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird
    of prey. It can become a {@creature giant eagle} for up to 1 hour. While the
    transformed eagle is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.
    As an action, you can see through the eagle''s eyes and hear what it hears until
    the start of your next turn, and you gain the benefit of its keen sight. During
    this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.","When you
    use an action to speak the item''s command word and place the keyrune on the
    ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into
    a {@creature giant eagle}. If there isn''t enough space for the eagle, the keyrune
    doesn''t transform.","The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other
    members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands
    your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the
    eagle takes the {@action Dodge} action and moves to avoid danger.","At the end
    of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if
    it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again
    while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can''t transform
    again until 36 hours have passed."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
