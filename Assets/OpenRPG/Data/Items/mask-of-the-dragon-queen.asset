    the five dragon masks resemble the dragons they are named for. When two or more
    of the dragon masks are assembled, however, they transform magically into the
    Mask of the Dragon Queen. Each mask shrinks to become the modeled head of a chromatic
    dragon, appearing to roar its devotion to {@creature Tiamat|RoT} where all the
    masks brought together are arranged crown-like on the wearer''s head. Below the
    five masks, a new mask shapes itself, granting the wearer a draconic visage that
    covers the face, neck, and shoulders.","While you are attuned to and wear this
    mask, you can have any of the properties from any one mask. Additionally, you
    gain the Damage Absorption from each of the five dragon masks, and you gain five
    uses of the Legendary Resistance property."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
