  Title: Staff of Flowers
  AsJson: '{"name":"Staff of Flowers","source":"XGE","page":139,"tier":"minor","rarity":"common","weight":4,"weaponCategory":"simple","property":["V"],"dmg1":"1d6","dmgType":"B","dmg2":"1d8","recharge":"dawn","rechargeAmount":"{@dice

    While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and
    cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of you,
    or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff
    creates a mildscented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows
    or withers as a normal flower would. The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended
    charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On
    a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever."]}'
