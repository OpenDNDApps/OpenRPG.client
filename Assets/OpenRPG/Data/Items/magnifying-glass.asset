  Title: Magnifying Glass
  AsJson: '{"name":"Magnifying Glass","source":"PHB","page":152,"srd":true,"basicRules":true,"type":"G","rarity":"none","value":10000,"entries":["This
    lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute
    for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass
    requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5
    minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability
    check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed."]}'
