    for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass
    requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5
    minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability
    check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed."]}'
