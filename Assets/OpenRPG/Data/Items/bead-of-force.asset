  Title: Bead of Force

    small black sphere measures \xBE of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce.
    Typically, {@dice 1d4 + 4} {@italic beads of force} are found together.\",\"You
    can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact
    and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed
    must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 5d4} force damage.
    A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature
    that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this
    sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area,
    are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside
    it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other
    effect can.\",\"An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's
    wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can
    be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the
    weight of creatures inside.\"],\"lootTables\":[\"Magic Item Table C\"]}"
