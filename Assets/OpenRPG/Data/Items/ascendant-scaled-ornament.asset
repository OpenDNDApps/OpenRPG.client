  Title: Ascendant Scaled Ornament
  AsJson: '{"name":"Ascendant Scaled Ornament","source":"FTD","_copy":{"name":"Wakened
    Scaled Ornament","source":"FTD","_preserve":{"page":true}},"rarity":"legendary","entries":["This
    ornament can be jewelry, a cloak, or another wearable accessory. It appears to
    be fashioned from a dragon''s scale, tooth, or claw, or it incorporates images
    in those shapes.","You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can''t be {@condition charmed}
    or {@condition frightened}. Moreover, each creature of your choice within 30
    feet of you has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid being {@condition
    charmed} or {@condition frightened} or to end those conditions on itself.","When
    you would take damage of the type dealt by the breath of the dragon in whose
    hoard the ornament became Wakened, you can use your reaction to take no damage
    instead, and you regain hit points equal to the damage you would have taken.
    Once this property is used, it can''t be used again until the next dawn.","While
    you are wearing the ornament, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed
    and can hover. While you are flying using this speed, spectral dragon wings appear
    on your back."]}'
