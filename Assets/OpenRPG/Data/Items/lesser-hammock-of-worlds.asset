  Title: Lesser Hammock of Worlds
  AsJson: '{"name":"Lesser Hammock of Worlds","source":"JttRC","page":214,"rarity":"legendary","wondrous":true,"entries":["The
    Hammock of Worlds is a colorful hammock woven with traditional Ataguan designs.","You
    can use an action to unfold and place the lesser version of the Hammock of Worlds
    on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or
    plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it
    leads or the user can cause it to always reliably connect to the Ghost Orchid
    Tepui. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges
    of the cloth and folding it up. Once the lesser version of the Hammock of Worlds
    has opened a portal, it can''t do so again for {@dice 1d8} hours."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
