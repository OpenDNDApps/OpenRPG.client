  Title: Soothsalts
  AsJson: "{\"name\":\"Soothsalts\",\"source\":\"EGW\",\"page\":152,\"type\":\"G\",\"rarity\":\"none\",\"value\":15000,\"entries\":[\"Soothsalts
    are derived from a naturally occurring crystalline substance discovered throughout
    the wilds of the Miskath Strand. The crimson crystals have been mined from cavernous
    veins like those in the mouth of the Miskath Pit and found within smaller geode
    formations near sites ravaged by the Calamity. Soothsalts are consumed orally
    in lozenge-sized doses, and frequent users can be identified by the telltale
    crimson stain around their mouths. A creature subjected to a dose of soothsalts
    gains advantage on all Intelligence checks for {@dice 1d4} hours.\",\"For each
    dose of soothsalts consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
    saving throw or gain one level of {@condition exhaustion}\u2014an effect which
    is cumulative with multiple doses.\"]}"
