    expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30
    feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
    become {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures
    in the area that aren''t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving
    throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each
    of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds
    on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The
    pipes regain {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn."],"optionalfeatures":["replicate
