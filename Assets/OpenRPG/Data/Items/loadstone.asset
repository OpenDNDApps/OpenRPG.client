    detect it. An {@spell identify} spell reveals the stone''s true nature. If you
    use the {@action Dash} or {@action Disengage} action while the stone is on your
    person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with {@spell remove curse}
    or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and
    maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the
