  Title: Scroll of the Comet
  AsJson: '{"name":"Scroll of the Comet","source":"IDRotF","page":315,"type":"SC","rarity":"legendary","entries":["By
    using an action to read the scroll, you cause a comet to fall from the sky and
    crash to the ground at a point you can see up to 1 mile away from you. You must
    be outdoors when you use the scroll, or nothing happens and the scroll is wasted.","The
    comet creates a 50-foot-deep, 500-foot-radius crater on impact. Any creature
    in that radius must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 30d10}
    force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful
    one. All structures in the crater are destroyed, as are all nonmagical objects
    that aren''t being worn or held."]}'
