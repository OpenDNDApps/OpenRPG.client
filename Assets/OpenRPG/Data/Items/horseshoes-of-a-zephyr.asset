    While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature,
    they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground.
    This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable
    surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores {@quickref

    up to 12 hours a day without suffering {@condition exhaustion} from a forced
