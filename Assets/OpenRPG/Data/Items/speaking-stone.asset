  Title: Speaking Stone
  AsJson: '{"name":"Speaking Stone","source":"ERLW","page":279,"rarity":"very rare","wondrous":true,"entries":["The
    key to long-distance, virtually instantaneous communication across Khorvaire
    is House Sivis''s network of message stations. Each station contains at least
    one speaking stone, which is carved from a Siberys dragonshard and inscribed
    with arcane symbols that uniquely identify it. If you''re a gnome with the Mark
    of Scribing, you can touch the stone and use an action to cast the {@spell sending}
    spell from it. The target is any other speaking stone whose location or unique
    sequence of symbols you know. A creature within 5 feet of the stone hears the
    message as if they were the target.","In a Sivis message station, a gnome is
    always on duty by the speaking stone, listening for messages that might come
    in and transcribing them for delivery to their intended recipients."],"attachedSpells":["sending"]}'
