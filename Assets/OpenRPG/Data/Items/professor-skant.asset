  AsJson: '{"name":"Professor Skant","source":"IDRotF","page":315,"_copy":{"name":"Professor
    Orb","source":"WDMM"},"entries":["The {@item professor orb|WDMM} owned by Vellynne
    Harpell and stolen by Nass Lantomir calls itself Professor Skant. It is lawful
    good, and it has a Wisdom of 11 and a Charisma of 9 {@note (as a professor orb,
    it has an Intelligence of 18)}. It speaks and reads Common, Draconic, Elvish,
    and Loross (the dead language of the Empire of Netheril). Professor Skant is
    a chatterbox and assumes all humanoids are dunderheads. When elaborating on its
    areas of expertise, it adopts an unintentionally patronizing tone. It has the
    following four areas of expertise:",{"type":"list","items":["The history of Netheril
    (see the \"{@adventure Fate of Netheril|IDRotF|17|Fate of Netheril}\" sidebar)","Vampirism
    and the traits of vampires","Rituals surrounding the making, bottling, and drinking
    of Elverquisst (a rare, ruby-colored elven liquor distilled from sunshine and
    rare summer fruits)","The {@creature tarrasque} (see the Monster Manual)"]},"When
    making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise,
    the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).","Professor
    Skant takes the form of a smooth, solid, 5-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz
    about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks
    of silver light deep inside the sphere.","Professor Skant can see and hear normally
    out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of
    its own and can''t initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.","In
    addition to the knowledge it possesses, Professor Skant can cast the {@spell
    mage hand} cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting
    ability is Intelligence."]}'
