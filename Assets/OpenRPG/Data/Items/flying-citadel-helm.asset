    function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a flying citadel on which
    it has been installed. The chair has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison
    and psychic damage. It is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.","The sensation
    of being attuned to a flying citadel helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect
    one experiences after one''s arm or leg falls asleep, but not as intense.","While
    attuned to a flying citadel helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities
    for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):",{"type":"list","items":["You
    can use the flying citadel helm to move the citadel through the air, up to 80
    feet per round, or up to 8 miles per hour.","You can steer the citadel, albeit
    in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used
    to maneuver a seafaring ship.","At any time, you can see and hear from the highest
    point outside the citadel as though you were at that location."]},"If no creature
    attuned to the helm is maintaining concentration, the citadel remains motionless
    in its space.",{"type":"entries","name":"Transfer Attunement","entries":["You
    can use an action or a bonus action to touch a willing spellcaster, whereupon

    the flying citadel helm be destroyed, the citadel it is installed on loses power
    and begins to crumble. If the crumbling citadel is in the air, it descends at
    a rate of 30 feet per round, or 300 feet per minute. Any creature on the citadel
    or on the ground within 120 feet of the citadel when it lands must make a DC
    20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 39 ({@damage 6d12}) bludgeoning damage on a
    failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."]}]}'
