  Title: Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments
  AsJson: "{\"name\":\"Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments\",\"source\":\"DMG\",\"page\":183,\"srd\":\"Marvelous

    found in {@dice 1d4} pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound
    in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting
    them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object
    as you concentrate on its image.\",\"Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover
    1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain
    features\u2014such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons\u2014that
    are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\",\"When
    you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real,
    nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that
    can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real
    pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\",\"Nothing
    created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an
    object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks
    authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some
    other worthless material.\",\"If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning,
    the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing
    no harm to anything.\"],\"lootTables\":[\"Magic Item Table D\"],\"hasFluffImages\":true}"
