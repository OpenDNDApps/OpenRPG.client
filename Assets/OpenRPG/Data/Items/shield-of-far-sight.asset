    {@creature mind flayer} skilled at crafting magic items creates a shield of far
    sight by harvesting an eye from an intelligent humanoid and magically implanting
    it on the outer surface of a nonmagical shield. The shield becomes a magic item
    once the eyes is implanted, whereupon the {@creature mind flayer} can give the
    shield to a thrall or hang it on a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is
    on the same plane of existence as its creator, the {@creature mind flayer} can
    see through the shield''s eye, which has {@sense darkvision} out to a range of
    60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the {@creature mind flayer}
    can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield.","If
    a shield of far sight is destroyed, the {@creature mind flayer} that created
    it is {@condition blinded} for {@dice 2d12} hours."]}'
