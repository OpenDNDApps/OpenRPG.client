    pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are
    holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into
    a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon
    that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.","The pestle
    has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend
    up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra {@damage 1d8} force damage for each charge
    expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn."]}'
