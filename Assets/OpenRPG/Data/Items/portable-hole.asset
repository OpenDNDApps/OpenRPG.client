    fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief.
    It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.","You can use an action
    to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon
    the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical
    space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can''t be used to create
    open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by
    climbing out of it.","You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking
    hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the
    hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space.
    No matter what''s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.","If the hole is folded
    up, a creature within the hole''s extradimensional space can use an action to
    make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way
    out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it.
    A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes,
    after which time it begins to suffocate.","Placing a portable hole inside an
    extradimensional space created by a {@item bag of holding}, {@item Heward''s
    handy haversack}, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate
    to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside
    the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited
    in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way
    only and can''t be reopened."],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table D"]}'
