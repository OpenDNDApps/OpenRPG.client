    this heavy cloth bag are {@dice 3d4} dry beans. The bag weighs \xBD pound plus
    \xBC pound for each bean it contains.\",\"If you dump the bag's contents out
    on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each
    creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw,
    taking {@damage 5d4} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
    a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't
    being worn or carried.\",\"If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt
    or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the
    ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table,
    determine it randomly, or create an effect.\",{\"type\":\"table\",\"colLabels\":[\"{@dice

    roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take {@damage

    chaotic evil and attacks.\"],[\"21-30\",\"An animate, immobile stone statue in
    your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and
    others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs
    the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence
    as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24
