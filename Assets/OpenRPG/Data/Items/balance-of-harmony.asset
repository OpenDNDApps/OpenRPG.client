    scale bears celestial symbols on one pan and fiendish symbols on the other. You
    can use the scale to cast {@spell detect evil and good} as a ritual. Doing so
    requires you to place the scale on a solid surface, then sprinkle the pans with
    holy water or place a transparent gem worth 100 gp in each pan. The scale remains
    motionless if it detects nothing, tips to one side or the other for good (consecrated)
    or evil (desecrated), and fluctuates slightly if it detects a creature appropriate
    to the spell but neither good nor evil. By touching the scales after casting
    the ritual, you instantly learn any information the spell can normally convey,
    and then the effect ends."],"attachedSpells":["detect evil and good"]}'
