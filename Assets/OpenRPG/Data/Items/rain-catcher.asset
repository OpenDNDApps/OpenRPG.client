    rain catcher is a simple contraption consisting of a 5-foot-square leather tarp
    and a wooden frame with legs. When the tarp is stretched across the wooden frame,
    it forms a basin that can catch 2 gallons of drinking water per inch of rainfall
    and hold up to 8 gallons. The tarp and wooden frame fold up for easy transport."]}'
