  Title: The Codicil of White
  AsJson: '{"name":"The Codicil of White","source":"IDRotF","page":317,"rarity":"unknown
    (magic)","wondrous":true,"entries":["The Codicil of White is a tall, thin volume
    bound in white ermine fur over seasoned boards of white pine and sealed with
    a clasp and lock of tarnished silver. The book is cold to the touch, and the
    fur is worn about the edges from use. The twenty-seven pages within are of vellum
    painted with silver gilt on the outer edges. The whole is sewn to a leather binding
    with strips of sinews, making it quite durable.","A creature with the codicil
    in its possession has resistance to cold damage.","The codicil was written by
    followers of Auril as a primer on her worship. The first page is a title page
    with the snowflake symbol of Auril on it. The remaining pages describe various
    priestly rituals and ceremonies in chilling detail. Nestled among these descriptions
    is a spell that wizards can learn ({@spell frost fingers|IDRotF}), and a poem
    called \"Rime of the Frostmaiden\" (see appendix E). The poem is an incantation,
    the power of which can be used to split a glacier (see chapter 6). The poem might
    have other capabilities, at your discretion"],"hasFluffImages":true}'
