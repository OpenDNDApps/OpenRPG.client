    {@creature djinni} from the Elemental Plane of Air. The {@creature djinni} appears
    in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long
    as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour,
    or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.","While
    summoned, the {@creature djinni} is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys
    any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command
    it, the {@creature djinni} defends itself against attackers but takes no other
    actions.","After the {@creature djinni} departs, it can''t be summoned again
    for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the {@creature djinni} dies."],"lootTables":["Magic
