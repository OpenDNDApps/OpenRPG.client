  Title: Pipe of Remembrance
  AsJson: '{"name":"Pipe of Remembrance","source":"GoS","page":229,"rarity":"common","wondrous":true,"entries":["This
    long, delicate wooden pipe features a bowl made from smooth river stone. When
    the pipe is lit, smoke exhaled from it does not dissipate, instead lingering
    around the bearer. After 10 minutes, the smoke forms moving shapes that reenact
    the bearer''s most impressive and heroic achievements for 5 minutes. When this
    realistic performance is complete, the smoke dissipates. The pipe can''t be used
    this way again until the next dawn."]}'
