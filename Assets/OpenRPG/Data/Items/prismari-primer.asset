    or a Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check while holding the primer, you can
    expend 1 charge to give yourself a {@dice 1d4} bonus to the check, immediately
    after you roll the {@dice d20}.","In addition, if you study the primer at the
    end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the bard or sorcerer
    spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell
    once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability
    for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma."]}'
