  Title: Survival Mantle
  AsJson: '{"name":"Survival Mantle","source":"VGM","page":81,"type":"MA","rarity":"unknown","weight":40,"ac":15,"stealth":true,"entries":["This
    carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer''s shoulders, neck,
    and chest. A survival mantle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half plate
    armor and takes just as long to don or doff. It can''t be worn with other kinds
    of armor.","A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe normally in any
    environment (including a vacuum) and has advantage on saving throws against harmful
    gases (such as those created by a {@spell cloudkill} spell, a {@spell stinking
    cloud} spell, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons)."]}'
