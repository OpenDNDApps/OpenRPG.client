  Title: Gruul Keyrune
  AsJson: '{"name":"Gruul Keyrune","source":"GGR","page":177,"rarity":"rare","reqAttune":"by
    a member of the Gruul guild","reqAttuneTags":[{"background":"gruul anarch|ggr"}],"wondrous":true,"entries":["This
    crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and
    animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms
    into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a {@creature rhinoceros} (and with
    the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.","When you use
    an action to speak the item''s command word and place the keyrune on the ground
    in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok.
    If there isn''t enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn''t transform.","The
    creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild
    (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages
    and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes
    the {@action Dodge} action and moves to avoid danger.","At the end of the duration,
    the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit
    points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching
    it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can''t transform again
    until 36 hours have passed."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
