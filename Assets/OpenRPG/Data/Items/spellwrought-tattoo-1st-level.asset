    the tattoo, you must hold the needle against your skin where you want the tattoo

    the tattoo, which appears on your skin. Once the tattoo is on your skin, you
    can cast its spell, requiring no material components. The tattoo glows faintly
    while you cast the spell and for the spell''s duration. Once the spell ends,
    the tattoo vanishes from your skin.","A spell cast from this tattoo has a spellcasting
    ability modifier of +3, a save DC of 13 and an attack bonus of +5."]}'
