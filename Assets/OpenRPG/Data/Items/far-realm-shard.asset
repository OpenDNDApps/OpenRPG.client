    writhing crystal is steeped in the warped essence of the Far Realm. As an action,
    you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry)
    or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard
    as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.","When you use a Metamagic
    option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can cause a
    slimy tentacle to rip through the fabric of reality and strike one creature you
    can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving
    throw against your spell save DC or take {@damage 3d6} psychic damage and become
    {@condition frightened} of you until the start of your next turn."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
