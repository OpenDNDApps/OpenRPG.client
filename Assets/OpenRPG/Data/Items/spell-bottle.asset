    while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.","While
    holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot
    level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original
    caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes
    empty once the spell is cast.","If you''re holding the empty bottle when you
    see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle
    as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting
    a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the
    bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence
