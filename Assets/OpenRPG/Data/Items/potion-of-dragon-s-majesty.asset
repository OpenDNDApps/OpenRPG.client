    potion looks like liquid gold, with a single scale from a {@filter chromatic|bestiary|search=chromatic
    dragon}, {@filter gem|bestiary|search=gem dragon}, or {@filter metallic|bestiary|search=metallic
    dragon} dragon suspended in it. When you drink this potion, you transform into
    an adult dragon of the same kind as the dragon the scale came from. The transformation
    lasts for 1 hour. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new
    form or falls to the ground (your choice). For the duration, you use the game
    statistics of the adult dragon instead of your own, but you retain your languages,
    personality, and memories. You can''t use a dragon''s Change Shape or its legendary
    or lair actions."]}'
