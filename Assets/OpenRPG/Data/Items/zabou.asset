    mushrooms feed on offal and the rotting wood of dead trees. If handled carefully,
    a zabou can be picked or uprooted without causing it to release its spores. If
    crushed or struck, a zabou releases its spores in a 10-foot-radius sphere. A
    zabou can also be hurled up to 30 feet away or dropped like a grenade, releasing
    its cloud of spores on impact. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC
    10 Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. The {@condition
    poisoned} creature''s skin itches for the duration. The creature can repeat the
    saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
    a success."]}'
