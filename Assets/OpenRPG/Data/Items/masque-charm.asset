    masque charm is a small silver pin. While wearing this charm, you can use an
    action to cast the {@spell disguise self} spell (DC 13 to discern the disguise).
    Once the spell is cast, it can''t be cast from the charm again until the next
    sunset. When casting the spell, you can have the spell last for its normal 1
    hour duration or for 6 hours. If you choose the 6-hour duration, the charm becomes
    nonmagical when the spell ends. In either case, the spell ends if the charm is
    removed from you."],"attachedSpells":["disguise self"]}'
