  Title: Blasting Powder
  AsJson: '{"name":"Blasting Powder","source":"EGW","page":225,"type":"G","rarity":"none","entries":["This
    volatile alchemical powder comes in a small pouch. When ignited by an open flame
    or a fuse, the powder explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding
    pouch must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 3d6} bludgeoning
    damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.","A character
    can bind multiple pouches of blasting powder together so they explode at the
    same time. Each additional pouch increases the damage by {@dice 1d6} (maximum
    of {@dice 10d6}) and the blast radius by 5 feet (maximum of 20 feet)."]}'
