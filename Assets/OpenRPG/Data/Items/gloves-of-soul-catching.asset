    a successful unarmed strike while wearing these gloves, you can use the gloves
    to deal an extra {@damage 2d10} force damage to the target, and you regain a
    number of hit points equal to the force damage dealt. Alternatively, instead
    of regaining hit points in this way, you can choose to gain advantage on one
