    feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case,
    make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an
    improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes {@damage 2d6}

    ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver,
    and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot."]}'
