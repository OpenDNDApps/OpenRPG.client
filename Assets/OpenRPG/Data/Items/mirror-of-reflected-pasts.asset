  Title: Mirror of Reflected Pasts
  AsJson: '{"name":"Mirror of Reflected Pasts","source":"DSotDQ","page":190,"rarity":"very
    rare","reqAttune":true,"wondrous":true,"weight":25,"entries":["This mirror of
    elven design allows those who stare into it to reflect on positive memories.
    The 3-foot-tall mirror weighs 25 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and
    vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed if reduced
    to 0 hit points.","While holding the mirror upright, you can use an action to
    speak its command word and activate it. While activated, the mirror hovers in
    the air, and it can be destroyed but not moved. It remains activated until you
    use an action to speak the command word again or your attunement to the mirror
    ends, at which point the mirror harmlessly floats to the ground. Once the mirror
    has been deactivated, it can''t be activated again until the next dawn.","If
    a non-Construct creature other than you sees its reflection in the activated
    mirror while within 30 feet of it, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
    saving throw or become {@condition paralyzed} until the mirror is deactivated
    or until that creature can no longer see the mirror. A creature {@condition paralyzed}
    by the mirror can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
    the effect on a success. If a creature''s saving throw is successful or the effect
    ends for it, the creature is immune to this mirror''s effect for the next 24
    hours.","While {@condition paralyzed} by the mirror, the creature sees events
    from their past reflected in the mirror''s glass. These memories aren''t real,
    but rather idealized versions of those occurrences. Nearby observers can glimpse
    flashes of these memories if looking indirectly at the mirror."]}'
