    wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its
    charges and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard
    out to a range of 60 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.","The wand
    regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand''s last charge,
    roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles to dust
    and is destroyed."]}'
