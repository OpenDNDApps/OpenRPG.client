  Title: Barking Box
  AsJson: '{"name":"Barking Box","source":"WDH","page":47,"type":"OTH","rarity":"unknown","entries":["This
    metal cube, 6 inches on a side, has a crank on top. Using an action to wind the
    crank activates the box for 8 hours. While activated, the box barks whenever
    it detects vibrations within 15 feet of it, as long as the box and the source
    of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. A switch
    on one side of the box sets the device to emit either a small dog''s bark or
    a large dog''s bark."]}'
