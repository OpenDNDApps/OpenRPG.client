    scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect
    their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully
    skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail
    is highly valued. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have
    advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons
    of dragons, and you have resistance to lightning damage.","Additionally, you
    can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction
    to the closest bronze dragon within 30 miles of you. This special action can''t
    be used again until the next dawn."]}'
