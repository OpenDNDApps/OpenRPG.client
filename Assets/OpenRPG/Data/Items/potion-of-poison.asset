    {@damage 3d6} poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
    throw or be {@condition poisoned}. At the start of each of your turns while you
    are {@condition poisoned} in this way, you take {@damage 3d6} poison damage.
    At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful
    save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by {@dice
    1d6}. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0."],"lootTables":["Magic
