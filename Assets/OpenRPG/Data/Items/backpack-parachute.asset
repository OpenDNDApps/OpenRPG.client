  AsJson: '{"name":"Backpack Parachute","source":"WDH","page":47,"type":"OTH","rarity":"unknown","entries":["A
    humanoid wearing this piece of gear can deploy the parachute as a reaction while
    falling, or as an action otherwise. The parachute requires at least a 10-foot
    cube of unoccupied space in which to deploy, and it doesn''t open fast enough
    to slow a fall of less than 60 feet. If it has sufficient time and space to deploy
    properly, the parachute allows its wearer to land without taking falling damage.
    Once it has been used, the parachute takes 10 minutes to repack."]}'
