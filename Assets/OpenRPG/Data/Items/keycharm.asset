    vital role in the work of House Kundarak. If you cast the {@spell alarm}, {@spell
    arcane lock}, or {@spell glyph of warding} spell, you can tie the effect to the
    keycharm so that whoever holds it receives the notification from the {@spell
    alarm} spell, bypasses the lock of the {@spell arcane lock} spell, or avoids
    triggering the glyph placed by the {@spell glyph of warding} spell. In addition,
    the holder (who needn''t be attuned to the item) can take an action to end any
    one spell tied to it, provided the holder knows the command word you set for
    ending the tied spells. The keycharm can have up to three tied spells at one
    time."]}'
