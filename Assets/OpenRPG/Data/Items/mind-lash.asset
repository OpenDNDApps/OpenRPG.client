    the hands of any creature other than a {@creature mind flayer}, a mind lash functions
    as a normal whip. In the hands of an illithid, this magic weapon strips away
    a creature''s will to survive as it also strips away flesh, dealing an extra
    {@damage 2d4} psychic damage to any target it hits. Any creature that takes psychic
    damage from the mind lash must also succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
    have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws for 1 minute.
    The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
    the effect on itself on a success."]}'
