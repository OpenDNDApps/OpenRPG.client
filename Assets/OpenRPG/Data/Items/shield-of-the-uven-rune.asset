    shield is made from the scale of an ancient white dragon. It has a rune burned
    into its outward-facing side. A character who examines the rune and succeeds
    on a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill History}) check recognizes it as an uven (\"enemy\"
    in Giant) rune that confers great power.","While holding the shield, you benefit
    from the following properties.",{"type":"entries","name":"Winter''s Friend","entries":["You

    can cast the {@spell bane} spell from the shield (save DC 17). The spell does
    not require concentration and lasts for 1 minute. Once you cast the spell from
    the shield, you can''t do so again until you finish a short or long rest."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Gift
    of Vengeance","entries":["You can transfer the shield''s magic to a nonmagical
    weapon by tracing the uven rune on the weapon with one finger. The transfer takes
    8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other.
    At the end, the shield is destroyed, and the rune is etched or burned into the
    chosen weapon. This weapon becomes a rare magic item that requires attunement.
    It has the properties of a +1 weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when the weapon
    is used against one of the following creature types, chosen by you at the time
    of the magic weapon''s creation: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons,
    elementals, fey, fiends, giants, or undead."]}],"attachedSpells":["bane"]}'
