    spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written as a mystical cipher.
    If the spell is on your class''s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast
    its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is
    unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell''s
    normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and
    it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.","If
    the spell is on your class''s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally
    cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine
    whether you cast it successfully. The DC is 10. On a failed check, the spell
    disappears from the scroll with no other effect.","Once the spell is cast, the

    from this scroll has a save DC of 13 and an attack bonus of {@hit 5}."],"spellScrollLevel":0,"lootTables":["Magic
