    usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash
    the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to
    20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature
    or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is
    covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after
    1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil.
    You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area,
    provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals
    5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area.
    A creature can take this damage only once per turn."]}'
