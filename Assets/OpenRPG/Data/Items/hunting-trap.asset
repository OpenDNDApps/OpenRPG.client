  Title: Hunting Trap
  AsJson: '{"name":"Hunting Trap","source":"PHB","page":152,"srd":true,"basicRules":true,"type":"G","rarity":"none","weight":25,"value":500,"entries":["When
    you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that
    snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap
    is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike
    driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a
    DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d4} piercing damage and stop moving.
    Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited
    by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action
    to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its
    reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped
    creature."]}'
