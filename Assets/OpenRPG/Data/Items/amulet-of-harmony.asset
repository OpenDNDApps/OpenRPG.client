  Title: Amulet of Harmony
  AsJson: '{"name":"Amulet of Harmony","source":"NRH-AT","page":8,"rarity":"legendary","reqAttune":true,"wondrous":true,"entries":["The
    amulet is a golden disk about 4 inches across. There are symbols etched into
    its surface and there are six bezels that hold the Gems of Power.","The Amulet
    of Harmony has the following properties:",{"type":"list","items":["While attuned
    to this amulet, you feel a pull in the direction of the Prismatic Well.","If
    the Prismatic Well is dormant, you can restore its power by expending your own
    energy. You must be within 10-feet of the well to restore its power and you must
    say the words, \"I invoke the power of the Prismatic Well and restore the colors
    of Harmony for all.\" If you do so, roll a {@dice d6}. On a 2-6, the power of
    the well is restored. On a 1, the well is restored but you fall into a deep,
    magical slumber for 1 year and cannot be roused except by a remove curse spell
    or similar magic.","You can turn off the power of the Prismatic Well, plunging
    all of Harmony into a polarized world where everything is horribly black and
    white. To do this, you must be within 10-feet of the well and you must say the
    words, \"I revoke the power of the Prismatic Well and withhold the colors of
    Harmony to all.\" If you do so, roll a {@dice d6}. On a 3-6, the well is turned
    off. On 1-2, the power of the well remains and you turn into a statue of black
    stone."]},"Only a wish spell can undo this effect."]}'
