  Title: Helm of Devil Command
  AsJson: '{"name":"Helm of Devil Command","source":"BGDIA","page":223,"rarity":"very
    rare","reqAttune":"by a creature that can speak Infernal","reqAttuneTags":[{"languageProficiency":"infernal"}],"wondrous":true,"charges":3,"entries":["This
    bulky, eyeless helmet is made for a {@creature pit fiend} but magically resizes
    to fit the heads of other wearers.","While wearing the helm, you can see out
    of it as though you weren''t wearing it. In addition, you know the exact location
    and type of all devils within 1,000 feet of you. You can telepathically communicate
    with a devil within range, or you can broadcast your thoughts to all devils within
    range. The devils receiving your broadcasted thoughts have no special means of
    replying to them.","The helm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge
    to cast {@spell dominate monster} (save DC 21), which affects devils only. (The
    spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any creature that''s not a
    devil.) If a devil can see you when you cast this spell on it, the devil knows
    you tried to charm it. The helm regains all its charges 24 hours after its last
    charge is expended.","If you are not a devil, using the helm''s {@spell dominate
    monster} property in the Nine Hells has a {@chance 20|20 percent} chance of attracting
    a {@creature narzugon|MTF}, which arrives on the back of a {@creature nightmare}
    mount in {@dice 1d4} hours. The narzugon tries to recover the helm, killing you
    if necessary to obtain it. If it gets the helm, the narzugon tries to deliver
    it to its infernal master."],"attachedSpells":["dominate monster"],"hasFluffImages":true}'
