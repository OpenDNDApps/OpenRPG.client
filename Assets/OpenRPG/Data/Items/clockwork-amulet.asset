    copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears and is powered by magic from Mechanus,

    can hear faint ticking and whirring noises coming from within.","When you make
    an attack roll while wearing the amulet, you can forgo rolling the {@dice d20}
    to get a 10 on the die. Once used, this property can''t be used again until the
