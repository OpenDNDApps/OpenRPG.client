    to Uthgar Gardolfsson\u2014leader of the folk who would become the Uthgardt barbarians\u2014in
    a battle that marked the ascendance of humankind over the giants in the Dessarin
    Valley. Gurt's greataxe was buried in Morgur's Mound until it was unearthed and
    brought back to Waterdeep. After laying in the city's vaults for decades, the
    axe was given to Harshnag, a {@creature frost giant} adventurer, in recognition
    of his service to Waterdeep. Uthgardt barbarians recognize the weapon on sight
    and attack any giant that wields it.\",\"You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage
    rolls made with this magic weapon. It is sized for a giant, weighs 325 pounds,
