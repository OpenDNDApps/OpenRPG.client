  Title: Rings of Shared Suffering
  AsJson: '{"name":"Rings of Shared Suffering","source":"UAWGE","page":117,"type":"RG","rarity":"uncommon","reqAttune":true,"entries":["These
    rings come in linked pairs. If you possess the Mark of Sentinel, you can use
    a bonus action to form a link to the creature attuned to the other ring; from
    then on, whenever that creature suffers damage, they only suffer half of that
    damage and you take the rest. This effect continues until you end it as a bonus
    action or until you or the other creature removes their ring. This effect isn''t
    limited by range. A creature cannot be attuned to more than one ring of shared
    suffering."]}'
