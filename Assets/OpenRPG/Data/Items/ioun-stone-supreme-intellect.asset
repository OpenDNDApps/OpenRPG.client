    {@italic Ioun stone} is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered
    on some worlds. Many types of {@italic Ioun stone} exist, each type a distinct
    combination of shape and color.","When you use an action to toss one of these
    stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of {@dice 1d3}
    feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action
    to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful
    attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics})
    check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.","A
    stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered
    to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.","You gain a +1
    bonus to Intelligence checks while this faceted sphere orbits your head."]}'
