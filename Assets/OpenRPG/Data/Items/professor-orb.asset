  Title: Professor Orb
  AsJson: '{"name":"Professor Orb","source":"WDMM","page":284,"rarity":"rare","wondrous":true,"sentient":true,"weight":5,"entries":["Each
    professor orb takes the form of a smooth, solid, 5-pound sphere of smoky gray
    quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more
    pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere.","A Professor Orb is sentient
    and has the personality of a scholar. Its alignment is determined by rolling
    on the alignment table in the \"{@book Sentient Magic Items|DMG|7|Sentient Magic
    Items}\" section in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master''s Guide|dmg}. Regardless
    of its disposition, the orb has an Intelligence of 18, and Wisdom and Charisma
    scores determined by rolling {@dice 3d6} for each ability. The orb speaks, reads,
    and understands four languages, and can see and hear normally out to a range
    of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of its own and can''t
    initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.","A Professor Orb
    has extensive knowledge of four narrow academic subjects. When making an Intelligence
    check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus
    to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).","In addition to the knowledge
    it possesses, a professor orb can cast the {@spell mage hand} cantrip at will.
    It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence."],"attachedSpells":["mage
