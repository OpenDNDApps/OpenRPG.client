    talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A creature that is neither good nor
    evil in alignment takes {@damage 6d6} radiant damage upon touching the talisman.
    An evil creature takes {@damage 8d6} radiant damage upon touching the talisman.
    Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding
    or carrying the talisman.","If you are a good cleric or paladin, you can use
    the talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls
    while you wear or hold it.","The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or
    holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature
    you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil alignment,
    a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity
    saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The
    fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last
    charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed."],"lootTables":["Magic
