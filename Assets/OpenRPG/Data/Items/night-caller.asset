  Title: Night Caller

    whistle is carved from transparent crystal, and it resembles a tiny dragon curled
    up like a snail. The name Night Caller is etched on the whistle in Dwarvish runes.
    If a character succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill History})
    check, the character recalls lore that says the {@creature duergar} made several
    such whistles for various groups in an age past.","If you blow the whistle in
    darkness or under the night sky, it allows you to cast the {@spell animate dead}
    spell. The target can be affected through up to 10 feet of soft earth or similar
    material, and if it is, it takes 1 minute to claw its way to the surface to serve
    you. Once the whistle has animated an undead creature, it can''t do so again
    until 7 days have passed.","Once every 24 hours, you can blow the whistle to
    reassert control over one or two creatures you animated with it."],"attachedSpells":["animate
    dead"]}'
