    in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it
    for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each
    creature and object within 10 feet of you become {@condition invisible} for {@dice
    2d4} minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed
    when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts
    a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature."],"lootTables":["Magic Item
