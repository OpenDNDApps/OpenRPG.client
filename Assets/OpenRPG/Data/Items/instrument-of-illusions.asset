    effects within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on the instrument. If you are
    a bard, the radius increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous
    musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical
    effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The
    effects end when you stop playing."]}'
