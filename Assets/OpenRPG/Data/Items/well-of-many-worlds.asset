    to unfold and place the well of many worlds on a solid surface, whereupon it
    creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the
    item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads. You can use an action to
    close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it
    up. Once well of many worlds has opened a portal, it can''t do so again for {@dice
