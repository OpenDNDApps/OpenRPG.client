    is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume
    Mountain.","You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
    weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop
    a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon.
    This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability
    checks while you can see the daytime sky.",{"name":"Thrown Weapon","type":"entries","entries":["Whelm
    has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60
    feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an
    extra {@damage 1d8} bludgeoning damage, or an extra {@damage 2d8} bludgeoning
    damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back
    to your hand after the attack. If you don''t have a hand free, the weapon lands
    at your feet."]},{"name":"Shock Wave","type":"entries","entries":["You can use
    an action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the
    point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of
    that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become {@condition
    stunned} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
    of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property
    can''t be used again until the next dawn."]},{"name":"Supernatural Awareness","type":"entries","entries":["While
    you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed
    doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast {@spell
    detect evil and good} or {@spell locate object} from the weapon. Once you cast
    either spell, you can''t cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn."]},{"name":"Sentience","type":"entries","entries":["Whelm

    read, and understand Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish
    when used in combat."]},{"name":"Personality","type":"entries","entries":["Whelm''s
    purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves
    against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins
    and giants or to protect dwarves. Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created
    it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned
    to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. The hammer
    also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it
    valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a {@creature vampire}. His
    will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing
    members of his own clan."]}],"attachedSpells":["detect evil and good","locate
