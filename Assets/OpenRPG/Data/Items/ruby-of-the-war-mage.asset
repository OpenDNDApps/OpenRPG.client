    with eldritch runes, this 1-inch-diameter ruby allows you to use a {@filter simple
    or martial weapon|items|source=phb|category=basic|type=martial weapon;simple
    weapon} as a spellcasting focus for your spells. For this property to work, you
    must attach the ruby to the weapon by pressing the ruby against it for at least
    10 minutes. Thereafter, the ruby can''t be removed unless you detach it as an
    action or the weapon is destroyed. Not even an {@spell antimagic field} causes
    it to fall off. The ruby does fall off the weapon if your attunement to the ruby
    ends."]}'
