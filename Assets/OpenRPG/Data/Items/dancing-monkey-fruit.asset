  Title: Dancing Monkey Fruit
  AsJson: '{"name":"Dancing Monkey Fruit","source":"ToA","page":205,"type":"OTH","rarity":"unknown
    (magic)","value":500,"entries":["This rare magical fruit produces enough juice
    to fill a vial. Any humanoid that eats a dancing monkey fruit or drinks its juice
    must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or begin a comic dance that
    lasts for 1 minute. Humanoids that can''t be {@condition poisoned} are immune
    to this magical effect.","The dancer must use all its movement to dance without
    leaving its space and has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws,
    and other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. Each time it takes
    damage, the dancer can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on
    a success. When the dancing effect ends, the humanoid suffers the {@condition
    poisoned} condition for 1 hour."]}'
