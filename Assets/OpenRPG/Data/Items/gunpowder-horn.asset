  Title: Gunpowder Horn
  AsJson: '{"name":"Gunpowder Horn","source":"DMG","page":268,"type":"EXP","rarity":"none","weight":2,"value":3500,"age":"renaissance","entries":["Gunpowder
    is chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a pistol or rifle, or
    it is formed into a bomb. Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs or in water-resistant
    powder horns.","Setting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause it to
    explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it ({@damage 3d6}
    for a powder horn). A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.
    Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes it to flare for 1 round, shedding
    bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet."]}'
