    In addition to storing normal maps, your cartographer''s map case can be used
    to generate a special map identifying a shortcut. You can use your action to
    make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, with a success revealing a map
    buried in your cartographer''s map case noting a relevant shortcut. Your travel
    time is reduced by half while you follow that route. If you succeed at the check
    by 5 or more, the map includes notes on the terrain, granting you advantage on
    the next ability check you make to travel through the mapped area in the next
    hour. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long
    rest."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Map of the Moment","entries":["Starting at
