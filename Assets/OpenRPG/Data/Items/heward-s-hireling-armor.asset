    number of Kwalish''s experiments were attempts to research the works of the legendary
    mage Heward, who first crafted what he named hireling armor. While wearing this
    armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, the armor''s animated straps can
    assist with the drawing and sheathing of weapons, such that you can draw or stow
    two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.","This
    armor also has six pockets, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each
    pocket can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic
    feet. The armor always weighs 10 pounds, regardless of its pockets'' contents.
    Placing an object into one of the armor''s pockets follows the normal rules for
    interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from a pocket of the armor requires
    you to use an action. When you reach into a pocket for a specific item, the item
    is always magically on top.","Placing the armor inside an extradimensional space
    created by a {@item bag of holding}, a {@item Heward''s handy haversack}, or
    a similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.
    The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature
    within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location
    on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can''t
    be reopened."],"containerCapacity":{"weight":[20,20,20,20,20,20],"weightless":true}}'
