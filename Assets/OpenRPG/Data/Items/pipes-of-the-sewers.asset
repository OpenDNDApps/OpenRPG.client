    use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant
    rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or
    harm them.","The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you
    can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one {@creature
    swarm of rats} with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within
    half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If
    there aren''t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms
    move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren''t under your
    control otherwise. The pipes regain {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn.","Whenever
    a {@creature swarm of rats} that isn''t under another creature''s control comes
    within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma
    check contested by the swarm''s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm
    behaves as it normally would and can''t be swayed by the pipes'' music for the
    next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes'' music
    and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to
    play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands.
    If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise
    takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can''t hear the pipes''
    music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally
    would and can''t be swayed by the pipes'' music for the next 24 hours."],"optionalfeatures":["replicate
