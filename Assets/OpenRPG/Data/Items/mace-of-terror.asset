    While it is {@condition frightened} in this way, a creature must spend its turns
    trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can''t willingly move to
    a space within 30 feet of you. It also can''t take reactions. For its action
    it can use only the {@action Dash} action or try to escape from an effect that
    prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use
    the {@action Dodge} action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat
    the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.","The mace regains
