    wearing the badge, you gain a +2 bonus to AC if you aren''t using a {@item shield|phb}.","If
    the badge is more than 5 feet away from you for more than 1 minute, it vanishes
    and harmlessly reappears on a surface within 5 feet of the Open Lord. While holding
    the badge, the Open Lord knows your location, provided the two of you are on
    the same plane of existence and your attunement to the badge hasn''t ended.","As
    an action, the Open Lord can touch the badge and end your attunement to it."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
