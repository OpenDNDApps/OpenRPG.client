    claws take the form of articulated digits that extend into long metal blades.
    The claws are knitted into the flesh and bones of a creature''s arms and can''t
    be removed without surgical amputation.","Each set of flensing claws is designed
    for a specific creature and can''t be used by anyone else. A creature equipped
    with flensing claws can use its action to make one melee weapon attack with the
    claws. The creature adds its proficiency bonus and Strength modifier to any attack
    roll made with the claws, and its Strength modifier to its damage roll when it
    hits a target with the claws."]}'
