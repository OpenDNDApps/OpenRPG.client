  Title: Scroll of Protection from Celestials
  AsJson: '{"name":"Scroll of Protection from Celestials","source":"DMG","page":199,"type":"SC","tier":"minor","rarity":"rare","entries":["Using
    an action to read the scroll encloses you in an {@condition invisible} barrier
    that extends from you to form a 5-foot-radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes,
    this barrier prevents celestials from entering or affecting anything within the
    cylinder. The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if
    you move in such a way that a celestial would be inside the cylinder, the effect
    ends. A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make
    a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the
    barrier."]}'
