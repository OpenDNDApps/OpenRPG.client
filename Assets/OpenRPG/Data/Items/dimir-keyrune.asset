    black stone accented with steel, resembles a stylized horror. On command, it
    transforms into an {@creature intellect devourer} that resembles the Dimir guild
    symbol, with six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours. During
    that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it\u2014usually an assignment
    to take over someone's body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time
    or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature
    returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form.\",\"When
    you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the
    ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into
    a {@creature intellect devourer}. If there isn't enough space for the creature,
    the keyrune doesn't transform.\",\"The creature is friendly to you, your companions,
    and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you).
    It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no
    commands, the creature takes the {@action Dodge} action and moves to avoid danger.\",\"At
    the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts
    early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command
    word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form,
    it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.\"],\"hasFluffImages\":true}"
