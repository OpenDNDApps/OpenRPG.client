    hearty silk unique to the region has long been a point of pride with the locals.
    When processed and woven properly, the resulting cloth is pride silk: an extremely
    flexible material with the durability of tanned leather. Pride silk has become
    a favorite cloth for use on military ship sails, war banners, and other utilitarian
    applications, but has also gained popularity in affluent circles. High-end clothing
    made from pride silk is both fashionable and protective, leading many nobles
    and wealthy merchants to seek full outfits and formal gowns made with it. The
    tailors skilled enough to create such outfits are few and far between, so while
    pride silk might be expensive as a raw material, outfits made of the cloth are
    prohibitively expensive for most common folk."]}'
