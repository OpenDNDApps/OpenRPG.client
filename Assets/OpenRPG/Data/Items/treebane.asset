    axe''s handle is carved with leaves and vines, and it weighs half as much as
    a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a
    plant creature, the target takes an extra {@damage 1d8} slashing damage. When
    a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its
    wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing
    damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical."]}'
