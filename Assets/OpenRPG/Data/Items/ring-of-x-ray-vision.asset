    wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word. When you
    do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has
    a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent
    and don''t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate
    1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker
    substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.","Whenever you use
