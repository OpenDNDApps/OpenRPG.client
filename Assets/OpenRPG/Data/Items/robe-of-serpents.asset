  Title: Robe of Serpents
  AsJson: '{"name":"Robe of Serpents","source":"SKT","page":236,"rarity":"uncommon","reqAttune":true,"wondrous":true,"entries":["A
    robe of serpents is a stylish silk garment that is popular among wealthy nobles
    and retired assassins. The robe is emblazoned with {@dice 1d4 + 3} stylized serpents,
    all brightly colored.","As a bonus action on your turn, you can transform one
    of the robe''s serpents into a {@creature giant poisonous snake}. The snake instantly
    falls from the robe, slithers into an unoccupied space next to you, and acts
    on your initiative count. The snake can tell friendly creatures from hostile
    ones and attacks the latter. The snake disappears in a harmless puff of smoke
    after 1 hour, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when you dismiss it (no action
    required). Once detached, a snake can''t return to the robe. When all of the
    robe''s snakes have detached, the robe becomes a nonmagical garment."]}'
