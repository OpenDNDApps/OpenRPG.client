    you die while wearing this gray crystal ring, you vanish and reappear in an unoccupied
    space within 5 feet of the space you left (or the nearest unoccupied space).
    You have a number of hit points equal to {@dice 3d6} + your Constitution modifier.
    If your hit point maximum is lower than the number of hit points you regain,
    your hit point maximum rises to a similar amount. If you have any levels of {@condition
    exhaustion}, reduce your level of {@condition exhaustion} by 1. Once the ring
    is used, it turns to dust and is destroyed."]}'
