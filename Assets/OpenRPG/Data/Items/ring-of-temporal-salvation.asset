    you die while wearing this gray crystal ring, you vanish and reappear in an unoccupied

    You have a number of hit points equal to {@dice 3d6} + your Constitution modifier.
    If your hit point maximum is lower than the number of hit points you regain,

    is used, it turns to dust and is destroyed."]}'
