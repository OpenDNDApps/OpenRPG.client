  AsJson: '{"name":"Uncommon Glamerweave","source":"ERLW","page":277,"rarity":"uncommon","wondrous":true,"entries":["Glamerweave
    is clothing imbued with harmless illusory magic. While wearing these clothes,
    you can use a bonus action to create a moving illusory pattern within the cloth.
    Alternatively, you can have the pattern rise from the cloth. For example, a glamerweave
    gown might be wreathed in harmless, illusory flames, while a glamerweave hat
    might have illusory butterflies fluttering around it.","When you make a Charisma
    ({@skill Performance}) or Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check while wearing
    the glamerweave, you can roll a {@dice d4} and add the number rolled to the check.
    Once you use this property, it can''t be used again until the next dawn."]}'
