    can cut this 50-foot coil of hempen rope into any number of smaller pieces, and
    then use an action to speak a command word and cause the pieces to knit back
    together. The pieces must be in contact with each other and not otherwise in
    use. A rope of mending is forever shortened if a section of it is lost or destroyed."]}'
