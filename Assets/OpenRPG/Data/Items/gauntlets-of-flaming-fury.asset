    you wear both of these steel gauntlets, any non-magical weapon you grasp with
    either gauntlet is treated as a magic weapon. As a bonus action, you can use
    the gauntlets to cause magical flames to envelop one or two melee weapons in
    your grasp. Each flaming weapon deals an extra {@damage 1d6} fire damage on a
    hit. The flames last until you sheath or let go of either weapon. Once used,
    this property can''t be used again until the next dawn."]}'
