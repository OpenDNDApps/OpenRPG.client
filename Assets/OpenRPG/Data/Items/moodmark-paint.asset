    thick, black paint is stored in a small jar, containing enough paint to apply
    moodmarks to one creature. The paint is dabbed on the face in spots or markings
    that often resemble the eyes of insects or spiders. Applying the paint in this
    way takes 1 minute.","For the next 8 hours, the marks change to reflect your
    mental state. A creature that can see you and makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom
    ({@skill Insight}) check can discern whether you are happy, sad, angry, disgusted,
    surprised, or afraid, as well as the main source of that emotion. For example,
    you might communicate fear caused by a monster you just saw around the corner,
    grief at the loss of a friend, or happiness derived from pride in your performance
    in combat. A dark elf has advantage on this check."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
