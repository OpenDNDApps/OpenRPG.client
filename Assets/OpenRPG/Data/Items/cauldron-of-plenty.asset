  Title: Cauldron of Plenty
  AsJson: "{\"name\":\"Cauldron of Plenty\",\"source\":\"IDRotF\",\"page\":314,\"rarity\":\"rare\",\"wondrous\":true,\"weight\":50,\"entries\":[\"This
    cauldron is made of thick copper that has turned green with age. It is 4 feet
    wide, has a mouth 3\xBD feet in diameter, weighs 50 pounds, and can hold up to
    30 gallons of liquid. Embossed on its bulging sides are images of satyrs and
    nymphs in repose, holding ladles. The cauldron comes with a lid and has side
    handles. It sits on five little clawed feet that keep it from tipping.\",\"If
    water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into
    a hearty, hot stew, which can provide one nourishing meal for up to four people
    per gallon. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally
    after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite
    the heat of the stew.\",\"The cauldron can create stew three times. It then ceases
    to function until the next dawn, when it regains all its uses.\"],\"miscTags\":[\"CF/W\"]}"
