    hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can use an action to expend 1 of

    appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The
    creature is neither friendly nor hostile, and it isn''t under your control. It
    behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when
    it drops to 0 hit points. The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn."]}'
