    Pyroconverger is an Izzet-made flamethrower. It carries a risk of malfunction
    each time you use it.","As an action, you can cause the Pyroconverger to project
    fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity
    saving throw, taking {@damage 4d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
    damage on a successful one.","Each time you use the Pyroconverger, roll a {@dice
    d10} and add the number of times you have used it since your last long rest.
    If the total is 11 or higher, the Pyroconverger malfunctions: you take {@damage
    4d6} fire damage, and you can''t use the Pyroconverger again until you finish
    a long rest."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
