  AsJson: '{"name":"Smoke Grenade","source":"DMG","page":268,"type":"EXP","rarity":"none","weight":2,"age":"modern","entries":["As
    an action, a character can throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. With
    a grenade launcher, the character can propel the grenade up to 120 feet away.","One
    round after a smoke grenade lands, it emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily
    obscured area in a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour)
    disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses
    it in 1 round."]}'
