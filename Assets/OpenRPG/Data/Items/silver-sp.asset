  Title: Silver (sp)
  AsJson: '{"name":"Silver (sp)","source":"PHB","page":143,"type":"$","rarity":"none","weight":0.02,"value":10,"entries":["Common
    coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of
    the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold
    piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).","With one gold
    piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled
    (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is
    the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly
    used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds
    or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don''t usually involve the exchange
    of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and
    the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.","One
    gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners.
    A silver piece buys a laborer''s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night''s
    rest in a poor inn.","One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are
    common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch,
    or a piece of chalk.","In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals
    sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum
    piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes
    arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece
    is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.","A
    standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
