    backpack-sized devices are created in pairs, with matching numbers engraved on
    them, and allow communication over a long distance using radio frequencies. While
    wearing a fargab, you can use an action to speak into the device''s mouthpiece
    and send a short message of twenty-five words or less to another creature wearing
    the matched fargab while it is within 18 miles of you. The message emits from
    the speakers of the device and can be heard up to 10 feet away from the device.
    If no creature is wearing the fargab, the speakers make static noises instead."],"hasFluffImages":true}'
