    a piece of writing up to one page in length and speak a creature''s name. The
    writing becomes {@condition invisible} to everyone other than you and the named
    creature for the next 24 hours. Either of you can dismiss the invisibility by

    attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo
    to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When
    the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo,
    which appears on the skin. If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as
    a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.","If
    your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears
