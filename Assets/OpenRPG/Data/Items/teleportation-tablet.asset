  Title: Teleportation Tablet
  AsJson: '{"name":"Teleportation Tablet","source":"CRCotN","page":216,"rarity":"rare","wondrous":true,"entries":["This
    clay tablet is eight inches long, four inches wide, and half an inch thick. Inscribed
    on it is the sigil sequence for a permanent teleportation circle. A creature
    that studies the sequence for 10 minutes can make a DC 21 Intelligence ({@skill
    Arcana}) check, learning the circle''s destination on a success.","You can use
    an action to break the tablet in half, turning it to dust. If the tablet is broken
    while it is on the same plane of existence as the teleportation circle whose
    sigil sequence was engraved on it, a 10-foot-diameter teleportation circle of
    glowing blue light appears on the ground in an unoccupied space you choose within
    30 feet of you. This teleportation circle has the characteristics of one created
    using the {@spell teleportation circle} spell, except that it connects to the
    teleportation circle whose sigil sequence appears on the tablet.","The teleportation
    circle created by the tablet disappears at the end of your next turn."]}'
