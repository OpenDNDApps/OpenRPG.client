    an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite and throw it at a point up
    to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12
    Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 3d6} bludgeoning damage on a failed save,
    or half as much damage on a successful one.","A character can bind sticks of
    dynamite together so they explode at the same time. Each additional stick increases
    the damage by {@damage 1d6} (to a maximum of {@damage 10d6}) and the burst radius
    by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet).","Dynamite can be rigged with a longer fuse
    to explode after a set amount of time, usually 1 to 6 rounds. Roll initiative
    for the dynamite. After the set number of rounds goes by, the dynamite explodes
    on that initiative."]}'
