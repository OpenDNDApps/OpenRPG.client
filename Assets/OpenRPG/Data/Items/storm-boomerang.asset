  Title: Storm Boomerang
  AsJson: '{"name":"Storm Boomerang","source":"PotA","page":223,"type":"R","rarity":"uncommon","weaponCategory":"simple","range":"60/120","dmg1":"1d4","dmgType":"B","entries":["This
    boomerang is a ranged weapon carved from {@creature griffon} bone and etched
    with the symbol of elemental air. When thrown, it has a range of 60/120 feet,
    and any creature that is proficient with the javelin is also proficient with
    this weapon. On a hit, the boomerang deals {@damage 1d4} bludgeoning damage and
    {@damage 3d4} thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution
    saving throw or be {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn. On a
    miss, the boomerang returns to the thrower''s hand.","Once the boomerang deals
    thunder damage to a target, the weapon loses its ability to deal thunder damage
    and its ability to stun a target. These properties return after the boomerang
    spends at least 1 hour inside an elemental air node."]}'
