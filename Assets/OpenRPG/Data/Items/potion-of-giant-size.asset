  Title: Potion of Giant Size
  AsJson: '{"name":"Potion of Giant Size","source":"SKT","page":236,"type":"P","rarity":"legendary","entries":["When
    you drink this potion, you become Huge for 24 hours if you are Medium or smaller,
    otherwise the potion does nothing. For that duration, your Strength becomes 25,
    if it isn''t already higher, and your hit point maximum is doubled (your current
    hit points are doubled when you drink the potion). In addition, the reach of
    your melee attacks increases by 5 feet.","Everything you are carrying and wearing
    also increases in size for the duration. When rolling damage for weapons enlarged
    in this manner, roll three times the normal number of dice; for example, an enlarged
    longsword would deal {@damage 3d8} slashing damage (instead of {@dice 1d8}),
    or {@damage 3d10} slashing damage (instead of {@dice 1d10}) when used with two
    hands.","When the effect ends, any hit points you have above your hit point maximum
    become temporary hit points. This potion is a pale white liquid made from the
    tongue of a giant clam, with a pungent aroma akin to that of rotting algae. It
    tastes sweet, however, when consumed."]}'
