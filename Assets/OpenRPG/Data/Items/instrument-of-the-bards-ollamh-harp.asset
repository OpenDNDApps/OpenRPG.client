    instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary
    instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after
    a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without
    being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage
    2d4} psychic damage.","You can use an action to play the instrument and cast
    one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can''t
    be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting
    ability and spell save DC.","You can play the instrument while casting a spell
    that causes any of its targets to be {@condition charmed} on a failed saving
    throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if
    the spell has a somatic or a material component.","All instruments of the bards
    can be used to cast the following spells: {@spell fly}, {@spell invisibility},
    {@spell levitate}, and {@spell protection from evil and good}.","In addition,
    the Ollamh harp can be used to cast {@spell confusion}, {@spell control weather},
    and {@spell fire storm}."],"attachedSpells":["confusion","fly","invisibility","levitate","protection
