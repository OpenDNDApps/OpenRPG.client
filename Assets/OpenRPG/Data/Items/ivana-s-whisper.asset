  Title: Ivana's Whisper
  AsJson: '{"name":"Ivana''s Whisper","source":"VRGR","page":83,"type":"G","rarity":"unknown","poison":true,"entries":["This
    poison bears a distinct scent and chemical message from Ivana Boritsi. A creature
    subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or
    experience the effects of a {@spell dream} spell created by Ivana the next time
    they sleep. This poison is nonmagical, and Ivana doesn''t directly communicate
    with those affected during the dream. Rather, she creates the illusion of speaking
    with her intended target by alchemically crafting her message, predicting her
    target''s reactions, and chemically encoding in her responses. She wears this
    poison as a perfume or hides it within gift bouquets, allowing it to convey her
    message later."],"poisonTypes":["inhaled"],"attachedSpells":["dream"]}'
