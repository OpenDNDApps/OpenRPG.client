    resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain.
    A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope,
    or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures,
    equipment, and creatures within the area aren''t changed in appearance.","The
    tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the
    area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn''t obvious
    by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence
    ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A
    creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed
    on the terrain."],"abilityCheck":["intelligence"],"areaTags":["C"]}'
