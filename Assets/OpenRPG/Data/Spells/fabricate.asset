    range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot
    cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material.
    If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however,
    the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single
    5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the
    quality of the raw materials.","Creatures or magic items can''t be created or
    transmuted by this spell. You also can''t use it to create items that ordinarily

    objects."],"miscTags":["OBJ","PRM","SGT"]}'
