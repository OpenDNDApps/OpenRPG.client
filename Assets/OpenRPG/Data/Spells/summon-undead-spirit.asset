    cast the spell, choose the creature''s form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The
    creature physically resembles a humanoid with the chosen form, which also determines
    some of the traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to
    0 hit points or when the spell ends.","The creature is friendly to you and your
    companions for the spell''s duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative

    defends itself but otherwise takes no action."],"entriesHigherLevel":[{"type":"entries","name":"At
