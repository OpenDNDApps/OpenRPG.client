    immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into
    existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or
    a solid box as you choose.","A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20
    feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.","A
    prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid
    barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells
    cast into or out from the area.","When you cast the spell, any creature that
    is completely inside the cage''s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within
    the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the
    center of the area until they are completely outside the area.","A creature inside
    the cage can''t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation
    or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving
    throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure,
    the creature can''t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect.
    The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.","This
    spell can''t be dispelled by {@spell dispel magic}."],"savingThrow":["charisma"],"areaTags":["C"]}'
