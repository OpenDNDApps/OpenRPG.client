    target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form through
    the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution saving throw,
    taking {@damage 10d12} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
    on a successful one. If the save fails, the target also ages to the point where
    it has only 30 days left before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target
    has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its
    walking speed is halved. Only the {@spell wish} spell or the {@spell greater
    restoration} cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these effects and restore
    the target to its previous age."],"damageInflict":["necrotic"],"savingThrow":["constitution"],"miscTags":["SGT"],"areaTags":["ST"]}'
