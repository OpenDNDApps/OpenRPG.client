    uses the {@creature Reaper Spirit|UA2022WondersOfTheMultiverse} stat block. The

    or when the spell ends.","The reaper spirit is an ally to you and your companions.
    In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
    after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you), but it
    will only attack the haunted creature. If you don''t issue the spirit any commands,
    it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its move to avoid danger."],"entriesHigherLevel":[{"type":"entries","name":"At
