    create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that
    is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and
    lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn''t accompanied by
    sound, smell, or other sensory effects.","You can use your action to cause the
    image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can
    alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For
    example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the
    image so that it appears to be walking.","Physical interaction with the image
    reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
    that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion
    with a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell
    save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can
    see through the image."],"abilityCheck":["intelligence"]}'
