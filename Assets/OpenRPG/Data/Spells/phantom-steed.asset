    Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space
    of your choice within range. You decide the creature''s appearance, but it is

    spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from
    the steed.","For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed.
    The creature uses the statistics for a {@creature riding horse}, except it has
    a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast
    pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute
    to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed
    takes any damage."],"miscTags":["SMN"]}'
