    you cast the spell, choose a type of warrior: barbarian, fighter, or monk. The
    warrior resembles a humanoid armed appropriately to the chosen class, which determines
    certain traits in its stat block. The warrior disappears when it drops to 0 hit
    points or when the spell ends.","The warrior is an ally to you and your companions.
    In combat, the warrior shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
    after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you
    don''t issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its move to avoid
    danger."],"entriesHigherLevel":[{"type":"entries","name":"At Higher Levels","entries":["When
