    The only actions a creature can take in this form are the {@action Dash} action
    or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time
    a creature is {@condition incapacitated} and can''t move. Until the spell ends,
    a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.","If
    a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends
    60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can''t
    land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance."],"conditionInflict":["incapacitated"],"miscTags":["SGT"],"areaTags":["MT"]}'
