  Title: Meld into Stone
  AsJson: '{"name":"Meld into Stone","source":"PHB","page":259,"srd":true,"level":3,"school":"T","time":[{"number":1,"unit":"action"}],"range":{"type":"point","distance":{"type":"touch"}},"components":{"v":true,"s":true},"duration":[{"type":"timed","duration":{"type":"hour","amount":8}}],"meta":{"ritual":true},"entries":["You
    step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body,
    melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration.
    Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing
    of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.","While
    merged with the stone, you can''t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom
    ({@skill Perception}) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with
    disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on
    yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone
    where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can''t move.","Minor
    physical damage to the stone doesn''t harm you, but its partial destruction or
    a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels
    you and deals {@damage 6d6} bludgeoning damage to you. The stone''s complete
    destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals
    50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall {@condition prone} in an
    unoccupied space closest to where you first entered."],"damageInflict":["bludgeoning"],"conditionInflict":["prone"]}'
