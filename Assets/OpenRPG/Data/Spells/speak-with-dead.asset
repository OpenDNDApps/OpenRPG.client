    this spell within the last 10 days.","Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse
    up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the
    languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the
    corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to
    it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn''t return the creature''s
    soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can''t learn new
    information, doesn''t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and
    can''t speculate about future events."],"affectsCreatureType":["aberration","beast","celestial","construct","dragon","elemental","fey","fiend","giant","humanoid","monstrosity","ooze","plant"]}'
