    summon a {@creature hezrou} that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within
    range. The {@creature hezrou} disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when
    the spell ends.","The {@creature hezrou}''s attitude depends on the value of
    the food used as a material component for this spell. Roll initiative for the
    {@creature hezrou}, which has its own turns. At the start of the {@creature hezrou}''s
    turn, the DM makes a secret Charisma check on your behalf, with a bonus equal
    to the food''s value divided by 20. The check DC starts at 10 and increases by
    2 each round. You can issue orders to the {@creature hezrou} and have it obey
    you as long as you succeed on the Charisma check.","If the check fails, the spell
    no longer requires concentration and the demon is no longer under your control.
    The {@creature hezrou} then focuses on devouring any corpses it can see. If there
    are no such meals at hand, it attacks the nearest creatures and eats anything
    it kills. If its hit points are reduced to below half its hit point maximum,
    it returns to the Abyss.","As part of casting the spell, you can scribe a circle
    on the ground using the blood of an intelligent humanoid slain within the past
    24 hours. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. The summoned {@creature
    hezrou} cannot cross the circle or target anyone in it while the spell lasts."],"abilityCheck":["charisma"],"miscTags":["SGT","SMN"]}'
