    up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence
    as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it.
    Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus''s hit point
    maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce
    you to no lower than 1 hit point, and the change to your and the homunculus''s
    hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit
    point maximum can''t be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus''s
    death.","You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while
