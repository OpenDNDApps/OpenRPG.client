    you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed
    with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your
    choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence
    as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open
    until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly
    appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied
    space if that space is occupied.\",\"Many major temples, guilds, and other important
    places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their
    confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence\u2014a string of
    magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability
    to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the
    Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences
    during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying
    it for 1 minute.\",\"You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting
    this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the
    circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.\"],\"miscTags\":[\"PRM\",\"TP\"]}"
