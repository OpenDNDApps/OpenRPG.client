    create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of
    floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures
    can''t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the {@spell
    gate} spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel,
    and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral
    Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the {@spell plane shift} spell.","In
    addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast
    it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends,
    and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell''s area for the first time
    on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes {@damage 5d10} radiant
    or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).","When you cast this
    spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it
    enters the area takes no damage from the spell.","The spell''s area can''t overlap
    with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day
    for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and
    the material components are consumed on the last casting."],"damageInflict":["necrotic","radiant"],"affectsCreatureType":["celestial","elemental","fey","fiend","undead"],"miscTags":["PRM"]}'
