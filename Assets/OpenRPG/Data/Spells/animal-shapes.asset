    Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form,
    and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points
    it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit
    points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
    damage doesn''t reduce the creature''s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn''t
