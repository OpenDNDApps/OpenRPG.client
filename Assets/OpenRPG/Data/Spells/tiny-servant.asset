    touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn''t attached to another object or a
    surface and isn''t being carried by another creature. The target animates and
    sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the
    spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. See the {@creature tiny servant|xge|stat
    block} for its statistics.","As a bonus action, you can mentally command the
    creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures
    with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing
    the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take
    and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general
    command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue
    no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile
    creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until
    its task is complete.","When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to
    its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form."],"entriesHigherLevel":[{"type":"entries","name":"At
