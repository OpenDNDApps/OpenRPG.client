  Title: Move Earth
  AsJson: "{\"name\":\"Move Earth\",\"source\":\"PHB\",\"page\":263,\"srd\":true,\"level\":6,\"school\":\"T\",\"time\":[{\"number\":1,\"unit\":\"action\"}],\"range\":{\"type\":\"point\",\"distance\":{\"type\":\"feet\",\"amount\":120}},\"components\":{\"v\":true,\"s\":true,\"m\":\"an

    an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape
    dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You
    can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or
    flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed
    half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can
    create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by
    up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes
    for these changes to complete.\",\"At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating
    on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.\",\"Because the
    terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be
    trapped or injured by the ground's movement.\",\"This spell can't manipulate
    natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate
    the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable,
    it might collapse.\",\"Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth.
    The moved earth carries any plants along with it.\"],\"areaTags\":[\"Q\"]}"
