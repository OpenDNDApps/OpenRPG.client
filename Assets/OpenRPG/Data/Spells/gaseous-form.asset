    to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
    saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and
    even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces.
    The target can''t fall and remains hovering in the air even when {@condition
    stunned} or otherwise {@condition incapacitated}.","While in the form of a misty
    cloud, the target can''t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying
    or holding can''t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target
    can''t attack or cast spells."],"areaTags":["ST"]}'
