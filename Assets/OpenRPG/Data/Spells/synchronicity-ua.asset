    grants advantage to Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks, since the target always
    finds a handy piece of cover available. Additionally, the target has advantage
    on all ability checks made to drive a vehicle.","In the event that two or more

    of the spells would oppose each other."],"areaTags":["ST"]}'
