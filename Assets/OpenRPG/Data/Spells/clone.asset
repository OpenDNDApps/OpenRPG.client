    This clone forms inside the vessel used in the spell''s casting and grows to
    full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone
    be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely,
    as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.","At any time after the clone matures,
    if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that
    the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to
    the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none
    of the original''s equipment. The original creature''s physical remains, if they
    still exist, become inert and can''t thereafter be restored to life, since the
    creature''s soul is elsewhere."],"miscTags":["PRM"]}'
