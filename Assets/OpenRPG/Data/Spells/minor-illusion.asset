    you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be
    your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other
    sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you
    can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.\",\"If you
    create an image of an object\u2014such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small
    chest\u2014it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound,
    light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image
    reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\",\"If a creature
    uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that
    it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check
    against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is,
    the illusion becomes faint to the creature.\"],\"abilityCheck\":[\"intelligence\"]}"
