    summon a Small air elemental to a spot within range. The air elemental is formless,
    nearly transparent, immune to all damage, and cannot interact with other creatures
    or objects. It carries an open, empty chest whose interior dimensions are 3 feet
    on each side. While the spell lasts, you can deposit as many items inside the
    chest as will fit. You can then name a living creature you have met and seen
    at least once before, or any creature for which you possess a body part, lock
    of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the creature''s body.","As
    soon as the lid of the chest is closed, the elemental and the chest disappear,
    then reappear adjacent to the target creature. If the target creature is on another
    plane, or if it is proofed against magical detection or location, the contents
    of the chest reappear on the ground at your feet.","The target creature is made
    aware of the chest''s contents before it chooses whether or not to open it, and
    knows how much of the spell''s duration remains in which it can retrieve them.
    No other creature can open the chest and retrieve its contents. When the spell
    expires or when all the contents of the chest have been removed, the elemental
    and the chest disappear. The elemental also disappears if the target creature
    orders it to return the items to you. When the elemental disappears, any items
    not taken from the chest reappear on the ground at your feet."],"entriesHigherLevel":[{"type":"entries","name":"At
