    site and mapped it. If the landmark appears on no map in existence, the spell
    fails. Otherwise, whenever you move toward the hand, it moves away from you at
    the same speed you moved, and it moves in the direction of the landmark, always
    remaining 5 feet away from you.","If you don''t move toward the hand, it remains
