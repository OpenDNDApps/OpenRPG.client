    20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a
    Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it
    wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two
    effects.","You can suppress any effect causing a target to be {@condition charmed}
    or {@condition frightened}. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes,
    provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.","Alternatively,
    you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile
    toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell
    or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the
    creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise."],"savingThrow":["charisma"],"affectsCreatureType":["humanoid"],"areaTags":["S"]}'
