    The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier
    or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can
    form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet,
    or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each
    panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch
    thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature''s space
    when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice
    which side).","Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to
    all damage and can''t be dispelled by {@spell dispel magic}. A {@spell disintegrate}
