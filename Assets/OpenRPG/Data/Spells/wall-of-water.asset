    The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall''s space is {@quickref difficult

    on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through
    the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through
    the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least
    a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC
