    illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the
    duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it''s impossible
    to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory
    duplicates.","Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell''s
    duration, roll a {@dice d20} to determine whether the attack instead targets
    one of your duplicates.","If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or
    higher to change the attack''s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you
    must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.","A
    duplicate''s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate,
    the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that
    hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three
    duplicates are destroyed.","A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can''t
    see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can
    perceive illusions as false, as with {@sense truesight}."]}'
