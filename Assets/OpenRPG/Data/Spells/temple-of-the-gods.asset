  Title: Temple of the Gods
  AsJson: '{"name":"Temple of the Gods","source":"XGE","page":167,"level":7,"school":"C","time":[{"number":1,"unit":"hour"}],"range":{"type":"point","distance":{"type":"feet","amount":120}},"components":{"v":true,"s":true,"m":{"text":"a
    holy symbol worth at least 5 gp","cost":500}},"duration":[{"type":"timed","duration":{"type":"hour","amount":24}}],"entries":["You
    cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range.
    The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each
    side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god,
    pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.","You
    make all decisions about the temple''s appearance. The interior is enclosed by
    a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and
    as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you
    cast the spell can open or close the door.","The temple''s interior is an open
    space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated
    and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning
    incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.","The temple opposes
    types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of
    the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature
    of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma
    saving throw. On a failed save, it can''t enter the temple for 24 hours. Even
    if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it
    makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple,
    it must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the number rolled from the {@dice d20}
    roll.","In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can''t appear inside
    the temple, and creatures within can''t be targeted by divination spells.","Finally,
    whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level
    or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier
    (minimum 1 hit point).","The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends
    into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple''s interior.
    Nothing can physically pass through the temple''s exterior. It can''t be dispelled
    by {@spell dispel magic}, and {@spell antimagic field} has no effect on it. A
    {@spell disintegrate} spell destroys the temple instantly.","Casting this spell
    on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent."],"savingThrow":["charisma"],"affectsCreatureType":["celestial","elemental","fey","fiend","undead"],"miscTags":["HL","PRM","SGT"]}'
