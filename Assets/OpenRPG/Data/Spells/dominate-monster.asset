    attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed

    telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
    You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you
    are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify
    a simple and general course of action, such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Run
    over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order and
    doesn''t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself
    to the best of its ability.","You can use your action to take total and precise
    control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only
    the actions you choose, and doesn''t do anything that you don''t allow it to
    do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but
    this requires you to use your own reaction as well.","Each time the target takes
