    touch the ground and conjure forth a defensive structure made of enormous playing
    cards. The structure rises with you at its center, harmlessly lifting you and
    any creatures in the area. The house of cards has a square base that is 30 feet
    on each side, and it has three floors with 10- foot-high ceilings. The second
    floor is 20 feet on each side, and the top floor is 10 feet on each side\u2014both
    centered above the bottom floor. Ramps connect the interior of each floor, and
    empty doorframes connect the interior and exterior of each level. Creatures inside
    or on top of the structure have half cover.\",\"Each card that comprises the
    house is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall and is very fragile. A card has AC 10 and
    1 hit point. The cards are immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a card
    to 0 hit points destroys it. Every time a card is destroyed, roll {@dice 1d6}.
    If you roll a 5 or a 6, the house collapses, ending the spell.\",\"The house
    and all its cards vanish when the spell ends.\"]}"
