    human doll stuffed with ash or dust. You then stitch up the doll and drip your
    blood on it. At the end of the casting, you tap the doll with a crystal rod,
    transforming it into a {@filter magen|bestiary|search=magen|source=IDRotF} clothed
    in whatever the doll was wearing. The type of magen is chosen by you during the
    casting of the spell. See {@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21} for different kinds
    of magen and their statistics.","When the magen appears, your hit point maximum
    decreases by an amount equal to the magen''s challenge rating (minimum reduction
    of 1). Only a {@spell wish} spell can undo this reduction to your hit point maximum.","Any
