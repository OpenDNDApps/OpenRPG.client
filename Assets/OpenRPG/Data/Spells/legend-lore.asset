    or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief
    summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist
    of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been
    widely known. If the thing you named isn''t of legendary importance, you gain
    no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more
    precise and detailed the information you receive is.","The information you learn
    is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you
    have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information:
    \"Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the
    hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin,
    may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg
    on the lips.\""],"miscTags":["OBJ"]}'
