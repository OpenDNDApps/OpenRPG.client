  Title: Encode Thoughts
  AsJson: '{"name":"Encode Thoughts","source":"GGR","page":47,"level":0,"school":"E","time":[{"number":1,"unit":"action"}],"range":{"type":"point","distance":{"type":"self"}},"components":{"s":true},"duration":[{"type":"timed","duration":{"type":"hour","amount":8}}],"entries":["Putting
    a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind
    and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand,
    which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought
    strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless,
    semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise
    stationary.","If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability
    that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as {@spell
    detect thoughts} or {@spell modify memory}), you can transform the thoughts or
    memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.","Casting this
    spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever
    memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting {@spell detect
    thoughts} on the strand has the same effect.)"]}'
