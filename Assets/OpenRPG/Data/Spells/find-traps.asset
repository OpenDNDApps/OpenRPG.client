  Title: Find Traps
  AsJson: '{"name":"Find Traps","source":"PHB","page":241,"srd":true,"level":2,"school":"D","time":[{"number":1,"unit":"action"}],"range":{"type":"point","distance":{"type":"feet","amount":120}},"components":{"v":true,"s":true},"duration":[{"type":"instant"}],"entries":["You
    sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap,
    for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden
    or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically
    intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected
    by the {@spell alarm} spell, a {@spell glyph of warding}, or a mechanical pit
    trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling,
    or a hidden sinkhole.","This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You
    don''t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of
    the danger posed by a trap you sense."]}'
