    fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the
    mansion but can''t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell
    dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures

    spaces nearest to the entrance."],"miscTags":["OBJ"]}'
