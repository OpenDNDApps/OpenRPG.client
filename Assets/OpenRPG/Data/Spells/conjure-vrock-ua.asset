  AsJson: '{"name":"Conjure Vrock (UA)","source":"UAThatOldBlackMagic","page":3,"level":5,"school":"C","time":[{"number":1,"unit":"action"}],"range":{"type":"point","distance":{"type":"feet","amount":60}},"components":{"v":true,"s":true,"m":{"text":"a
    gem worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes","cost":10000,"consume":true}},"duration":[{"type":"timed","duration":{"type":"hour","amount":1},"concentration":true}],"entries":["You
    summon a {@creature vrock} that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within
    range. The {@creature vrock} disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when
    the spell ends.","The {@creature vrock}''s attitude depends on the value of the
    gem used as a material component for this spell. Roll initiative for the {@creature
    vrock}, which has its own turns. At the start of the {@creature vrock}''s turn,
    the DM makes a secret Charisma check on your behalf, with a bonus equal to the
    gem''s value divided by 20. The check DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each
    round. You can issue orders to the {@creature vrock} and have it obey you as
    long as you succeed on the Charisma check.","If the check fails, the spell no
    longer requires concentration and the {@creature vrock} is no longer under your
    control. The {@creature vrock} takes no actions on its next turn and uses its
    telepathy to tell any creature it can see that it will fight in exchange for
    treasure. The creature that gives the {@creature vrock} the most expensive gem
    can command it for the next {@dice 1d6} rounds. At the end of that time, it offers
    the bargain again. If no one offers the {@creature vrock} treasure before its
    next turn begins, it attacks the nearest creatures for {@dice 1d6} rounds before
    returning to the Abyss.","As part of casting the spell, you can scribe a circle
    on the ground using the blood of an intelligent humanoid slain within the past
    24 hours. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. The summoned {@creature
    vrock} cannot cross the circle or target anyone in it while the spell lasts."],"abilityCheck":["charisma"],"miscTags":["SGT","SMN"]}'
